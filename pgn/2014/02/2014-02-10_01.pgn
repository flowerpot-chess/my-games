1. Nf3 {The Reti opening. Not sure I've played against that one before.
Consulted Wikipedia and 365 Chess Openings.} d5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 c6 4. O-O
Bg4 5. d3 Nbd7 {To allow for ...e7-e5.} 6. Nbd2 e5 7. h3 Be6 (7. .. Bh5 8.
g4 Bg6) 8. Nb3 Qc7 {I want to play ...Nf8-c5, but that overloads the Knight
on d7, which will be asked to defend two pieces . The text adds a defender
of the e5-pawn. Here Stockfish wants me to play h7-h6, presumably to take
away the g5-square from White.} 9. Bg5 Nc5 {Stockfish doesn't like this
move, it wants me to play Bf8-d6. My idea with this move was partly to
entice White to exchange Knights, bringing my Bishop to c5 where it would
be lined up to attack/pin the f2-pawn.} 10. Qd2 Bd6 {I was considering
...h7-h6, but figured it would only provoke Bxf6, and I wasn't sure I
wanted that. Obviously, as long as my Knight stays on f6 I don't have a say
in the matter, but I was still considering options. At this point I had
more or less decided to castle Queen-side, since a King-side castle
definitely would be followed by Bxf6 and my King would be exposed.} 11.
Nxc5 Bxc5 {This was the exchange I had been hoping for, but to be honest I
hadn't followed the whole calculation through.} 12. Bxf6 gxf6 13. d4
{Stockfish thinks I'm better off (to the tune of 0.5 pawn or so) to move my
Bishop to e7 instead.} exd4 (13. .. Be7 14. dxe5 fxe5 15. Rfd1 O-O (15. ..
O-O-O 16. Qe3 e4 17. Nd4) 16. Qh6 e4 17. Nd4 (17. Ng5 Bf5 18. c4 Rad8) 17.
.. Qe5) 14. Nxd4 {Stockfish evaluates this position to very close to
completely equal.} O-O-O 15. Nxe6 {Ok, so the exchange is not done yet.}
fxe6 16. Qf4 Qg7 {Stockfish wants me to exchange Queens, but I don't want
to. Instead I'm defending the f6-pawn.} (16. .. Qf7 {Can't remember why I
chose ...Qg7 and not Qf7 . Stockfish evaluates this move to be slightly
better than Qg7, but not by much.}) (16. .. Qe7 {About the same evaluation
as ...Qf7.}) 17. e3 Bd6 18. Qd4 Kb8 {Backing up the a7-pawn. Also moves the
King off the h3-b8 diagonal, out of reach of the White Bishop.} 19. Qg4
Qxg4 {Here Stockfish wants me to avoid the exchange with ...Qf7, but this
time I wanted it. Mainly because it will open up the h-file, and leave the
g4-pawn weak for a moment.} 20. hxg4 Rhg8 21. g5 {Bad move, that gives away
the pawn. Better would have been e.g. Bf3, after which I don't really have
any follow-up.} fxg5 {Take with the f-pawn or with the Rook? After a long
consideration I decided to take with the pawn, to create a tandem with the
h-pawn.} 22. Rfd1 h5 {...Rd8-f8 is an obvious candidate move here, bringing
the Rook to the open f-file.} 23. e4 h4 24. exd5 exd5 25. Rd3 hxg3 26. fxg3
Rdf8 {This is an inaccuracy, that allows White to contest the f-file via
Rf3. I should have played ...g5-g4 first.} 27. Rc3 {Here White deals with
the threat of ...Bc5+, followed by ...Rh8+, which wins the White Bishop.
This was a line I saw over the board. See variation.} (27. c4 Bc5+ 28. Kh1
Rh8+ 29. Bh3 Rxh3+ 30. Kg2 g4) 27. .. g4 {To be honest, I didn't play g4 to
prevent the Rook from going to f3 (that was revealed to me in post-game
analysis), but more to take away a couple of squares from the Bishop.} 28.
Re1 {White places the Rook on the wrong square.} Bb4 {Will win a Rook for a
Bishop.} 29. Rce3 Bc5 {Figured it was no rush to take the first Rook
offered.} 30. b4 Bxb4 {Figured I could just as well grab a pawn too. This
might be a mistake, though, and Stockfish says ...Bb6, keeping the e3-Rook
pinned, is better by +3 or so.} 31. Rf1 Bc5 32. Re1 Bxe3+ {A mistake.
Should have played ...Re8, but here I started feeling nervous about leaving
the Rook on the board. I figured that the longer I wait with capturing, the
greater the chance of me messing up. See variation.} (32. .. Re8 {This
allows me to get both White Rooks for a Rook and my Bishop, or,
alternatively the e3-Rook clean off the board without giving up my Bishop
in return.} 33. Bf1 Bxe3+ 34. Kg2 (34. Rxe3 Rxe3) 34. .. Rgf8 35. Re2) 33.
Rxe3 Re8 {Figured an exchange of Rooks would be great for Black here.} 34.
Kf2 Rgf8+ (34. .. Rxe3 {Is there a difference skipping the check before the
exchange?} 35. Kxe3 Re8+ 36. Kf2 {No, not much (as far as my untrained eye
can tell).} Rh8) 35. Ke2 Rxe3+ 36. Kxe3 Rh8 {Next stop h2. Stockfish wants
me to push the b-pawn instead.} 37. Bf1 Rh2 {Not a very effective move now
that White can play Bd3, protecting the c-pawn.} 38. Be2 {But White didn't
play Bd3.} Kc7 {Here I should have played ...Rg2, and ...Rxg3 can't be
stopped . Instead I figured that the Rook-Bishop situation was kind of
static, so I starting preparing for a pawn-push and getting my King more
active.} 39. a4 Kd6 40. Bxg4 Rxc2 41. Bc8 b6 {...Ra2 would have been
better. Yes, The Bishop would capture the b-pawn, but my Rook would gobble
up the a-pawn, and the rest of my pawns are safe from both the White Bishop
and the White King, at least for a while.} 42. g4 Rc3+ 43. Kd2 Rc4 44. g5
{Here I realized that my Rook was kind of awkwardly placed on the 4th rank,
since g4 is covered by the Bishop (would like to get some piece of mind and
get the g-pawn off the board). But at least now I can capture on a4.} Ke7
{But no, instead I decided that I REALLY wanted to get rid of that g-pawn.}
45. g6 Kf8 {Why not Kf6? That seems more direct.} 46. Bd7 Kg7 47. Be8
{*Sigh*} b5 {I guess I was thinking "Not Rxa4 because then Bxc3".} 48. axb5
cxb5 49. Bxb5 {Oops, didn't think that one through. What happened to all my
pawns?} Rc5 50. Be8 {Probably not the best use of the Bishop.} a5 51. Ke3
Rc8 52. Bf7 a4 {Maybe ...Rd8 first? The text hangs the d5-pawn. I'm
probably still winning, but I'm making it unnecessarily close.} 53. Kd4 a3
54. Bxd5 Rd8 {Ha!} 55. Ke4 Rxd5 56. Ke3 {It obviously doesn't matter, but
capturing the Rook still seems the natural thing to do.} a2 57. Ke2 a1=Q
58. Ke3 Qe5+ 59. Kf2 Rd3 {Interesting game. Ended up with a hige advantage
in the end, but played a long row of very unprecise move. Luckily my
advantage was large enough for it to be difficult NOT to win, even for me.
White resigns} 0-1
