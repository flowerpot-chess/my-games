1. e4 {Friend Mode game against Shredder, as Black.} c5 {Want to get more
experience with the Sicilian.} 2. b3 {White decides to go with a fringe
line of the Sicilian, the Snyder variation.} Nc6 3. Bb2 d6 4. Nc3 Nf6 5.
Nf3 g6 6. Nd5 {Yikes. I wonder if I it would have been better to play ...e6
in the previous move? Perhaps not, it must surely be common in the Sicilian
for the White Knight on c3 to have the d5-square available, at least for a
while?} Bg7 {...Nxd5 is of course impossible, since I'll lose my Rook.
Stockfish recommends ...e7-e5 instead, and after Nxf6 to recapture with my
Queen (possible since the e5-pawn blocks the b2-Bishop.} 7. Nxf6+
{Interesting situation with the two Bishops facing each other on the long
diagonal.} Bxf6 {Not sure if ...exf6 would have been better. This way
forces an exchange of Bishops, and my e-pawn will end up on f6 anyway.} 8.
Bxf6 exf6 9. Bb5 Bd7 {Mostly so that I can recapture with the Bishop rather
than the pawn should White go for the exchange.} 10. O-O O-O 11. d4 Re8
{Stockfish wants me to play ...cxd4 instead.} 12. dxc5 dxc5 13. Qd5
{According to Stockfish, this is a small mistake from White, and Black
gains a +0.5 advantage by playing ...Qe7.} a6 {At this point I didn't
really have any ideas.} 14. Bc4 Re7 {White is threatening Qxf7. Stockfish
says ...Re7 is a mistake, since the c5-pawn is hanging, and that I should
have played ...Qe7. On the other hand, White's pawn on e4 is also hanging,
so after Qxd5 I would answer with Rxe4. (I saw this over the board.)} 15.
Rfd1 {White doesn't capture the pawn, but builds up the pressure on the
d-file.} (15. Qxc5 Rxe4 16. Bd5 Re7) 15. .. Qe8 {Moving the Queen off the
hot d-file. Stockfish says ...Qa5 would be a better move, again,
presumably, because of the situation with the c5-pawn. But e4 is also still
hanging.} 16. Qxc5 Rxe4 17. Qd6 Be6 18. Bd3 Rd8 {Here I did take into
account that White can choose to exchange his Queen for both my Rooks.} 19.
Bxe4 {And sure enough, White decided to go for that.} Rxd6 20. Rxd6 Qe7 21.
Rad1 Ne5 {...Nb4 would have been a better option. See variation.} (21. ..
Nb4 22. a3 f5 23. Bxb7 Nxc2 24. Bxa6 Bxb3 25. Bf1 Nxa3 26. Rd7 Qb4) 22. h3
h5 23. c4 {Here I realized pretty quickly that the c-pawn would cause me
trouble. How do I stop it?} Kg7 24. c5 a5 25. Nd4 {This is where I left it
in the morning, going out for a run and then to work.} Bc8 {I spent a lot
of time thinking about what to do here. I considered several options, but
any move that leaves the Bishop on e6 would allow Nxe6+ and White gets my
Bishop for his Knight, and I really want to keep my Bishop. I also
considered ...Bd7. Granted, that would leave the b2-pawn hanging, but I
figured that after Bxb2 I could answer with ...Bxh3. See the variation for
the line I calculated, which caused me to drop that idea. The only thing I
was left with then was ...Bc8, but I calculated some lines for this move to
and it didn't look promising at all.} (25. .. Bd7 26. Bxb7 Bxh3 27. gxh3
Qxb7 28. c6 {Actually, now I don't remember what I calculated after this
position, and this doesn't look nearly as bad as what I remembered. I think
I found that ...Qc7 would be catastrophic, and that I also tried ...Qb6 and
found that wanting. Stockfish suggests ...Qb8. (Stockfish also says that
white is almost +3 here, so either way this is obviously not a particularly
good position for Black.)} Qc7 (28. .. Qb6 29. Rd7 Qa6 30. Rd5) 29. Ne6+
fxe6 30. Rd7+ Qxd7 31. Rxd7+ {No way to stop the c-pawn from promotion.})
26. Nf3 {I felt completely dominated by White during the game, but
Stockfish evaluates this position as dead equal!} Qc7 {A bad move. Here I
missed that ...Be6 would bring us back to the same position as after move
24, which kind of indicates that White is also having a hard time getting
something to happen, and maybe a draw wouldn't be out of the question. My
idea with the move was simply to try to become a bit more active in the
position, by attacking that bothersome c5-pawn. Another move I considered
was ...f5. ...Nxf3 too, but after Bxf3 I wasn't sure I would have
accomplished much.} (26. .. f5 27. Bd5 Nxf3+ 28. Bxf3 Qe5 29. c6 bxc6 30.
Bxc6 f4 31. Bf3 Be6) 27. Nxe5 fxe5 28. c6 Qe7 {A blunder. I saw a scary
line after ...bxc6, and thought this move would give me some option. While
waiting for Black to move I realized that Black now has several ways of
winning material.} (28. .. bxc6 29. Rxc6 {It was at this point that I
didn't see a way for me to save both my Queen and my Bishop. But ...Qb8,
suggested by Stockfish in post-game analysis, seems ok for Black. White is
still better, but it's not as clear cut as after 28...Qe7. Maybe it was the
scary ...Qb7 line that made me give up all ideas of ...bxc6.} Qb8 (29. ..
Qb7 30. Rxg6+) 30. Rdc1 Be6) 29. cxb7 (29. Bxg6 {This was another line I
saw for White while I was waiting for the next move.} fxg6 30. Rd7 Bxd7 31.
Rxd7) 29. .. Bxb7 30. Rd7 {This was one of the lines I saw myself .} Qxd7
{Briefly considered letting my Queen flee to a3, but then I lose the Bishop
outright. This way we at least stay closer in material, but White is
obviously winning.} 31. Rxd7 Bxe4 32. Ra7 g5 33. Rxa5 f6 34. f3 Bc2 35. b4
{Here I realized that moving my Bishop to c2 was a really bad idea, since
it now becomes awkward to stop the b-pawn.} Kg6 36. b5 Bf5 37. b6 Bc8 38.
Ra8 Bb7 39. Ra7 Bc8 40. a4 {I resigned here. A weird game, where only a
couple of my pieces ever made it as far up the board as to the 4th rank (a
Rook on move 16, which was soon exchanged away, and then my Bishop on move
31). I was in defensive mode more or less constantly from move 6 and
onward. Black resigns} 1-0
