1. e4 {Quick game as White against Windows' Chess Titans, level 5.} e5 2.
Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez.} Nf6 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. O-O {Brings the King to
safety, and unpins the Knight. This is necessary if I'm to start expand in
the center, by pushing my d-pawn.} (5. d4 {To show what happens when the
c3-Knight is still pinned.} exd4 6. Nxd4 Nxe4) 5. .. Qe7 6. Re1 {Nd5 is
much stronger. See variation.} (6. Nd5 Qd6 (6. .. Nxd5 7. exd5 Qc5 8. Bxc6

pawn and pins the Knight.} a6 9. Bxc6 dxc6 10. dxe5 Bxc3 11. Bxf6 {Forks
the Queen and the Rook. Also, Black must be careful where he moves his
Queen, since there is a mate threat on d8.} Bxe1 {Black gives up his Queen
for a Rook and a pawn. 11...Qd7 is the strongest defence.} (11. .. Qc5 12.

exf6 Bd7 18. Rd1 {Inaccurate. Qxc7 is a mate in four, where as the text is
a mate in five :) I actually considered Qxc7, and the only reason I didn't
play it was that I had listen to a lecture by Ben Feingold earlier in the
day, where he kept reminding the students how good it is to attack with all
your pieces.} h6 19. Rxd7 hxg5 20. Qe5 {Another inaccurate move. Again Qxc7
is better.} (20. Qxc7 20. .. Ra8 21. Qd6+ Ke8 (21. .. Kg8 22. Rg7#) 22.
f7#) (20. Qxg5 Rg8 21. Qh6+ Ke8 22. Qh7 Rg7 23. Qxg7 a5 24. Qf7#) 20. ..
Rc8 {But Black repays the favor, allowing me to mate him quickly anyway.}
(20. .. Re8 21. Qxc7 g4 22. Qd6+ Kg8 (22. .. Re7 23. Qxe7+ Kg8 24. Qg7#)
23. Rg7#) 21. Qe7+ Kg8 22. Qg7# {Chess Titans Level 5 is no longer a
challenge, but I felt I needed a more relaxing game after a couple of
intense games against Shredder. I was also curious if the last month or so
of playing had made me a stronger player against a weaker opponent like
this. Takeaway from this game: The Nd5 motif that I missed in the opening.}
