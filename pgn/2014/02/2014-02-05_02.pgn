Ruy Lopez.} Nf6 {The Berlin Defence. There's been a lot of talk about the
Berlin Defence lately, much thanks to Magnus Carlsen's use of this defence
in the World Championship match against Anand.} 4. O-O a6 5. Ba4 b5 6. Bb3
h6 7. d4 Nxe4 8. Nxe5 {So far it's been pretty much standard moves.} Qe7 {A
blunder. Allows me to attack on f7. 8...Nxe5 9.dxe5 would be the standard
continuation.} 9. Bxf7+ {Should I take with the Bishop or the Knight? I
went with the Bishop, but Stockfish says Nxf7 is the stronger move. See
variation.} (9. Nxf7 Bb7 (9. .. Rh7 10. Re1 Bb7 11. Bd5 Nf6 (11. .. Qh4 12.

Qe2 Qh4 13. Bf3 {When the Knight moves the c6 pawn will be hanging.} Nd6
14. Bxc6 {Now if the d6-Knight moves, Qe8#.} Rb8 15. Nd2 {Developing the
Knight, heading for f3. Here I also considered Re1, threatening mate on e8
even with the Knight on d6. But Black can easily defuse that threat, e.g.
through ...Bd7.

I was also considering a move to protect the d4-pawn,
which is hanging to the Black Queen, e.g. c3 or Qe3 (not Qd3, because I
want to keep the mate-threat on e8 alive, forcing the d6-Knight to stay
put). Decided in the end that developing was more important than hanging on
to that pawn.} Qe7 (15. .. Qxd4 16. Re1 Bd7 17. Bxd7 Kxd7) 16. Re1 {Don't
want to exchange Queens on e7, allowing Black to recapture and develop his
Bishop at the same time. At the same time, I'm not completely against a
Queen exchange, being up two pawns and with Black's King out in the open,
so I'll let Black decide.} Rb6 17. Qd1 {I really don't want to move my
Bishop away from c6.} Bg4 18. f3 {Here I was on the fence between f3 and
Nf3. Went with f3, since the Bishop is now hanging, in addition to my Rook
attacking the Queen on e7.

Stockfish, in turn, recommends Bf3 as a
blocking move. But as I said before, I really like my Bishop on c6.} Be6
19. d5 {Now it's almost impossible for Black to avoid losing material. In
fact, Stockfish says ...Rxc6 here, trading the Rook for a Bishop, is the
best Black can do.} Qg5 20. Ne4 {Keeping the pressure up. Here I missed a
nice tractic, shown to me by Stockfish: Nd2-c4 discovers an attack on the
Queen by the c1-Bishop, and at the same time attacks the Rook on b6 (see
variation). This is a good example of "When you find a good move, look for
an even better one".} (20. Nc4 Qh4 {Why is this the best move for Black?
Why not ...bxc4?} (20. .. bxc4) 21. Nxb6 Bf5 22. Be3) 20. .. Qh4 21. g3 Qh5
22. Nxd6 Bxd6 23. Rxe6 {White won a piece in the exchange.} Qf5 24. Qe2
{Again threatening mate on e8.} Qf7 {Black resigned here.} 25. Qe3 {Here I
blundered. My idea was to follow up with Rxd6, and after ...cxd6 the Black
Rook on b6 would be hanging to my Queen. But what I missed was that I now
lined up my Queen and King on the diagonal, and Black still has his
dark-squared Bishop! I need to pay more attention to those
things.

Another candidate move I considered was Bf4, finally getting my
dark-squared Bishop into the game, attacking Black's counterpart on d6.
This sets up an exchange of Bishops, which would benefit White at this
point.

Stockfish recommends a2-a4.} Rxc6 26. dxc6 Bc5 {D'oh!} 27. Qxc5
Qxe6 {On the other hand, after the exhange the material balance is
identical to what it was before 25.Qe3: White is still up one Bishop and
two pawns.} 28. Bf4 {Better late than never. Developing the Bishop, and
setting up an attack on c7. Depending on what Black does, I could for
example follow up with Qa7, and perhaps a check on the 8th rank, which
could win me the Rook on h8. I've also opened the way for the a1-Rook,
which now can go to d1.} Qc4 29. Rd1+ Kc8 30. Qf5+ Kb8 31. Qd7 {Calculated
a couple of lines and found that this would be very difficult for Black to
defend. Bxc7+ is obviously also an alternative, but I thought I saw this
move working out better.} (31. Bxc7+ Kxc7 32. Qd7+ Kb6 33. Qb7+ Ka5 {This
is basically what I saw when I calculated Bxc7: The King could escape on
the a-file. Stockfish still says this is a mate in 10.} 34. Qc7+ Kb4 35.

realized that Black could play Qb6, which would throw a wrench in all the
lines I had calculated earlier.} Qe5 {Luckily, Black decided to stop caring
instead.} (32. .. Qb6 {Stockfish still says this is a mate in 9 for White.}

played 31.Qd7. But here I missed a quicker way to mate: sacrificing the
Queen!} (34. Qxc7+ Rxc7 35. Rd8+ {The Black Rook is pinned!} Ka7 36. Bd4#
