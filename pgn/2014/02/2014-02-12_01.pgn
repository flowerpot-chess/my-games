1. e4 {Early morning Friend Mode game as Black against Shredder.} e5
{Didn't do very good with the Sicilian yesterday, so wanted to go back to
more familiar territory.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The Scotch Opening. I played
the Scotch as White back on January 18 (an Alekhine Defense from Black that
transposed into the Scotch) and lost horribly. Let's see if I fair better
on the other side of the table.} exd4 {Skimmed through the Wikipedia
article on the Scotch. 3...d6 is bad for Black (see variation), and
3...exd4 is the standard move.} (3. .. d6 4. dxe5 dxe5 (4. .. Nxe5 5. Nxe5
dxe5 6. Qxd8+ Kxd8) 5. Qxd8+ Kxd8 (5. .. Nxd8 6. Nxe5)) 4. Nxd4 Bc5 {The
Classical Variation of the Main line.} 5. Nxc6 bxc6 6. Bd3 d6 {6...Qd4
could be an interesting option.} (6. .. Qh4 7. O-O (7. Qf3 7. .. d6) (7. g3
Qh3) 7. .. Nf6 8. Qf3 Bd6 9. g3) 7. O-O Ne7 {I got the idea of trying for
...f5. The main goal would be to open up the f-file for my Rook (after
castling). With my bishop on the g1-a7 diagonal this could allow me to
build up an attack on f2. I didn't spend much time calculating lines, but
decided it would be an interesting experiment. I fully expected it to crash
and burn, but either way I would learn something.

...Ne7 adds a second
defender of f5 (with the c1-Bishop). I figured that after ...f5 White would
either have to play exf5, or let his e-pawn stay put (e5 would just lose it
to ...dxe5, no?), in which case I would then play ...fxe4. Either way, the
f-file would open up.} 8. c3 O-O {Castle first, to get my King off the
e-file, that's very likely about to open up as well.} 9. Nd2 f5 {Here
goes!

Stockfish says this is a suspicious move for Black, with lines
like Nd2-b3, Qd1-e2, or Qd1-h5 giving a +0.5 advantage or more.} 10. b4 Bb6
11. Qh5 {Interesting. Now after ...fxe4 Bxe4 White will have a mate threat
on h7.} fxe4 12. Bxe4 {Time to put the defensive hat on.} Bf5 {This was
also the move suggested by Stockfish. The Bishop is well defended, but both
the Knight and the Rook.

And now Stockfish says Black is up about +0.5.}
13. a4 a5 {Must look after my Bishop.} 14. b5 d5 {Here I decided to let
White capture the c3-pawn if he wants. The White pawn on c3 won't be easily
defended, and I expect to be able to pick it off if necessary, e.g. by
moving the Queen to the 6th rank.} 15. Bxf5 Nxf5 16. Ba3 Nd6 {Another
option I considered was ...g7-g6.

One bad thing for Black in the current
position is that after a move like Nb3, my b6-Bishop's existense is
completely in the hands of the White Bishop. After Ba3-c5 an exchange can't
be avoided.

On the other hand, that would take the White Knight away
from the King-side, where he might be needed for defense, even without the
Black Bishop barreling down on f2.} (16. .. g6 17. Qd1 Re8 {This is the
move Stockfish suggests, but I probably wouldn't have played this, since I
was set on an attack on f2.} (17. .. Rf6 18. Nf3 {Here I could perhaps have
maneuvered my Queen to f7, and then somehow pry the Knight away from f3,
maybe even sacrificing my own Knight on h4. But the White Bishop's coverage
of f8 is very restricting.})) 17. bxc6 {This was the pawn sacrifice I had
already decided I would accept earlier.} Rf5 {Does two things: Threatens
the Queen, and gets the Rook off the f8-square, which frees up my Knight.
On the other hand, I probably want to move both my Queen and my a8-Rook to
the f-file as well, so my Knight will likely have to stay where it is for a
while.} 18. Qg4 Qf6 {Adding pressure on f2, and as a side-note also
threatens the pawn on c3.} 19. Qg3 Rf8 {Here I also considered ...Nf7,
swinging the Knight over to the King-side to join the attack. In the end I
decided to go full out on the f-file, while the opportunity was still
there.} 20. Qd3 {Bad move by Black. He really needs to get his King off the
g1-a7 diagonal, so Kh1 would be better. Also, not sure what I would do
after Nf3, I didn't spend much (any, really) time calculating.} (20. Nf3
Ne4 {Ah, nice move. I wonder if I would have seen this over the board.} 21.
Qg4 (21. Qh3 Nxf2 22. Rxf2 Qxc3 23. Rf1 Qxa3 24. Qg4 Bxf2+ 25. Rxf2 Qc5)
21. .. h5 22. Qh4 Rxf3 {Sets off a flurry of exchanges. I wonder if I would
have had the nerve to do this in the game.} 23. Qxf6 R8xf6 24. gxf3 Rg6+
25. Kh1 Nxf2+ 26. Rxf2 Bxf2) 20. .. Qg5 {I had four pieces attacking f2,
against only two defenders. Now I add an additional mate threat on g2 after
...Rxf2, which further limits White's options.} 21. Bxd6 {Too little, too
late, and loses the game. The Knight wasn't part of the attack, and White
really needed to focus on defense here.} (21. Kh1 Rxf2 22. Rxf2 Rxf2 23.
Qh3 Nf5 24. Nf3 {Even in material, but Black is obviously much better.
Still, there's no obvious immediate attack here, so the game would
certainly go on for a while (with plenty of time for Black to
blunder...).}) 21. .. Rxf2 22. Rxf2 Rxf2 {Threatening mate on g2.} 23. Qg3
Rf3+ {A discovered check wins the Queen (for a Rook).} 24. Kh1 Rxg3 25.
Bxg3 Qxd2 26. Be5 Qb2 27. Re1 Bf2 28. c4 {The Rook can't leave the 1st rank
because of the back-rank mate.} d4 {Simple, quiet move. No need to panic
and move the Queen away.} 29. Bxd4 {White really doesn't have any other
options left.} (29. Rd1 Qe2 30. Rb1 Qxe5) 29. .. Bxd4 30. Re8+ Kf7 {White
resigns} 0-1
