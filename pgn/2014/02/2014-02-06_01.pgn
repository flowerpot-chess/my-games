1. e4 e5 {Wanted to try a King's Pawn Game. Was hoping for a Ruy Lopez, to
practice that as Black.} 2. Nc3 {Nc3 instead of the more common Nf6. This
is the Vienna Game.} Nf6 {The most common second move for Black.} 3. a3
{The Mengarini's Opening. called "whimsical" in the Wikipedia article on
the Vienna Game.} Bc5 {"The best line for Black may be 3...Bc5" says
Wikipedia on the Mengarini Opening, so I went for that.} 4. b4 Bb6
{Stockfish says ...Bd4 is a good alternative here. I wasn't sure how long
the Bishop would be able to survive on that outpost though (e.g. after Nf3
White can force a Knight-Bishop exchange).} 5. Nf3 Nc6 {Stockfish
recommends 5...d5.} 6. Bc4 {Now White has a strong hold on the d5-square,
so d7-d5 is out of the picture.} d6 7. O-O O-O 8. h3 Be6 {Here I considered
several moves:

8...a6, to take away the b5-square from the White Knight.
On the other hand, I don't know if that Knight would want to go to that
square. (As it turned out, a6 would have been a great move for another
reason: it gives the b6-Bishop an escape square.)

8...Nd4, the move
recommended by Stockfish.

8... Re1.

I went for 8...Be3 for two
reasons: It keeps up the fight for d5, and if White wants to exchange
Bishops it opens up the f-file for my Rook (and my f-pawn, now on e6, would
also eye d5).} 9. d3 d5 {Big mistake. I wanted to open up the center, and
figured the exchange would be equal in material, but I stopped the
calculation one move too soon.} 10. Bxd5 Nxd5 11. exd5 Bxd5 12. Nxd5 Qxd5
13. c4 {Bam! This was the continuation I didn't see. To my credit, at least
I immediately realized that my Bishop was lost: After the Queen moves away,
c4-c5 traps the Bishop.} Qd6 {Considered sending the Bishop on a kamikaze
mission to f2, but that would only win back one pawn. This way I figured I
would get two pawns back for my piece.

One of the top lines from
Stockfish suggests Qd7 (forgetting about winning that second pawn),
followed by Rd8. In hindsight I can see how that might have improved my
situation, activating my Rook. As it turned out, I ended up spending lots
of moves getting my Queen out of the way, while White activated all his
pieces and gained complete control of the game.} 14. c5 Bxc5 15. bxc5 Qxc5
16. Bd2 a5 {To prevent Bb4, which would pin my Queen and Rook. In
hindsight, it would have been better to e.g. move the Rook to d8
(activating it), or the Queen to d5 (say), and then the Rook to d8. The
move I played is too passive.} 17. Qb3 b6 {Another purely defensive move -
the b-pawn was hanging to the Queen (or so I thought, see the ...Qd6
variation).} (17. .. Qd6 18. Qxb7 Rfb8 {The Queen is trapped!} 19. Qxa8
Rxa8) 18. Rfe1 Kh8 {To get my King off the a2-g8 diagonal, unpinning my
f-pawn. Another passive, purely defensive move, while White is activating
piece after piece.} 19. Rac1 Qd6 {Keeping the Queen as a second defender of
the e5-pawn, which is attacked twice.} 20. Be3 Nd4 21. Bxd4 exd4 22. Ne5
{Threatening Nxf7+, forking King and Queen. Black would have to capture
with the Rook, which then falls to the Queen.} Kg8 {The only choice.} (22.
.. Qe7 23. Ng6+ hxg6 24. Rxe7) (22. .. Qf6 23. Rc6 Qf5 24. g4 Qc8 25.
Nxf7+) 23. Rc6 {A great place for the White Rook. It's impossible for me to
chase it away.} Qe7 24. Nf3 Qd7 25. Qc2 Rac8 26. Rc1 {The c-pawn is about
to fall - I don't have any more defenders to add to it.} h6 27. Qc4 Rfd8
28. Rxc7 Rxc7 29. Qxc7 Qxc7 30. Rxc7 b5 31. Rc5 Rb8 32. Nxd4 Rd8 33. Nb3
Rxd3 34. Nxa5 g6 35. Kf1 Rxa3 36. Rxb5 {I pretty much had no clue how to
play in this type of situation. The rest of the game is basically just me
winging it, slowly but surely losing.} Kg7 37. Ke2 Ra2+ 38. Kf3 Ra3+ 39.
Nb3 f5 40. Kf4 Ra4+ 41. Kg3 Ra3 42. Kf3 Kf6 43. Kf4 Ra4+ 44. Ke3 Re4+ 45.
Kd3 g5 46. Ra5 Rf4 47. Ke2 Re4+ 48. Kd2 g4 49. hxg4 fxg4 50. Nc5 Rd4+ 51.

Kf5 64. Kd2 Ke5 65. Ke3 Kf5 66. Kd4 Kg5 67. Ke4 {It was here that I
realized that my King wouldn't be able to defend the pawn from the White
King. My King has very few choices where to move - lots of squares taken
away by the White pawn on g3 and the White King.} Kg6 68. Kf4 Kh5 69. Kf5
Kh6 70. Kxg4 {I resigned here. Black resigns} 1-0
