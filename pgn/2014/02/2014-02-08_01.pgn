{Not sure I've seen this move before. Here I started to worry about the
center. Black is already controlling d4, and if the c6-Knight moves out of
the way Black is also adding pressure on the e4-pawn.} 8. d3 h6 9. Nd5 (9.
a4 Nd4 10. Nxe5 (10. Nxd4 exd4 11. Ne2 O-O 12. c3 dxc3 13. bxc3) 10. ..
Nxb3 11. cxb3) 9. .. O-O 10. Be3 {I would welcome an exchange on e3, since
it would open up the f-file for my Rook.} d6 11. Nxf6+ Qxf6 12. Bd5 {Good
spot for the Bishop. If the Blacks bishop on b7 moves, the Knight on c6
falls. And if the Knight moves anywhere other than a5 or d8, the Bishop
falls. And there's really no Black piece of Pawn that can dislodge the
Bishop.} Bxe3 (12. .. Na5 13. Bxc5 dxc5 14. Qd2) 13. fxe3 {Now Black's
Queen is in a dangerous position. For example, Nd4, discovering an attack
on the Queen and also attacking the c6-Knight, would win a piece.} Qg6 14.
Nh4 {Here I thought for a long time, debating between Nh4 and d4. Settled
on Nh4, since I thought it would give me very good chances to start a
strong attack on the King.} (14. d4 Na5 (14. .. exd4 15. exd4 Na5 16. Bxb7
Nxb7) 15. Bxb7 Nxb7) 14. .. Qg5 {The only available square.} 15. Nf5 {My
plan is to follow up with Rf1-f3-g3, if possible, and then bring over the
Queen. My only concern is that this will take several moves to accomplish.
On the other hand, I don't see any immediate threats from Black.} a5 16.
Rf3 g6 17. Rg3 {The Rook is in place.} Qf6 {Stockfish actually says Black
should play ..Qxg3 here, giving up his Queen for my Rook.} 18. Nxh6+ {Here
I should have played Qh5. The g6-Pawn is pinned.} (18. Qh5 Ne7 (18. .. g5

Kg7 19. Qh5 {I debated between Qh5 and Nf5+. Went for Qh5, but Nf5 would
have been better. Had I been at home, playing with the board, I would
probably have spent more time thinking about this.} Rh8 {Here I felt like I
had squandered a great opportunity, allowing Black back into the game. I
could try Nf5+, but after Kf8 I don't really have a good follow up, and
both my Queen and Knight would be hanging.} 20. Rf1 {Glad I came up with
this move.} (20. Nf5+ Kf8 21. Qg5 Qxg5 22. Rxg5 gxf5 23. Rxf5 {White is
down a Knight, but up two Pawns. This game could go either way.}) 20. ..
Qxf1+ 21. Kxf1 Rxh6 {Got Black's Queen off the board, but had to give up a
Rook and a Knight.} 22. Qg4 {Qf5 would have been better, threatening f7.
But here I forgot that the g6-pawn is still pinned.} Rxh2 23. Rh3 {Bad
move. Bxf7 would have been much better. See variation.} (23. Bxf7 Kxf7 (23.

mate in 12.} Kf8 28. Kxh2) 24. Qxg6+ Ke7 25. Qg7+ Ke8 26. Qxc7 {This is
apparently a mate in 10.}) 23. .. Bc8 {Lined up my Queen and Rook nicely on
the diagonal...} 24. Qf3 {The best move. See variations for a couple of
inferior alternatives.} (24. Bxc6 24. .. Bxg4 25. Rxh2 Ra6 26. Bxb5 Rb6 27.
a4 {White is up a pawn, but the position is more or less equal.}) (24. Qh4
Bxh3 25. gxh3 Rh8 26. Qg4 {And Black is all of a sudden winning. The White
King is exposed, and the two Rooks on the h-file are killers.}) 24. .. Bxh3

{A fun game. I'm glad I saw the King-side attack, and also managed t get it
going. Then, of course, I almost threw the game away with a series of
unprecise moves. I played this game during Chinese class, so I didn't have
my chess board, and didn't spend too much time thinking. It would have been
nice to see how I had played if I had spent a little more time calculating
the various lines.} 1-0
