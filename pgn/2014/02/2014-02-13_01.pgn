1. e4 e6 {The French defence. Not very familiar with it.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3
{The Paulsen variation. Can be considered the main line according to
Wikipedia.} Nc6 {Black deviates from the main line. This is "[A]n eccentric
idea" according to Wikipedia.} 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. e5 Ne4 6. Bd3 Bb4 7. Bd2
{Another alternative would be a3, perhaps initiating an exchange on c3. The
text allows Black to exchange his e4-Knight for my dark-squared Bishop.}
Nxd2 8. Qxd2 Bd7 9. a3 Be7 {Black seems happy with having both Bishops.}
10. O-O O-O 11. Ne2 {Here I was stuck for a while, not having any concrete
ideas of how to proceed. Decided to transfer the Knight over to the
King-side, to perhaps get something going there. Very vague. Another option
I considered was Rf1e1. Stockfish gives Ra1d1 as its main move.} f5 {This
move took me by surprise. ...f6 would have been more expected.

The move
is a mistake according to Stockfish, who wants me to play c2-c4 for a +1
advantage.} 12. Ne1 {I want to block Black's f-pawn with my own. This is a
mistake, says Stockfish. The +1 advantage after 12.c4 has now turned into
an equal position.} (12. c4 12. .. g5 13. cxd5 exd5 14. Qc2) (12. Nf4 {This
was one move I considered, for blocking the f-pawn, but realized that after
...g5 the Knight would just have to move back to e2.} g5) 12. .. Qe8 13. f4
Qh5 14. Ng3 Qg6 15. Nf3 a6 16. a4 {At this point focus switched to the
Queen-side, and my inexperience in pawn-management soon became apparent.
Stockfish has been wanting me to play c2-c4 for many moves now, including
this one. Not sure why I played a3-a4 here.} Nb4 {My previous move weakened
the b4-square, and Black takes advantage.} 17. Be2 c5 18. c3 Nc6 {I was
pretty happy with how I handled the Black Knight (Bd3-e2 and c2-c3). My
happiness didn't last long though.

Here I spent a lot of time thinking
about my next move. One threat to deal with is Nc6-a5-b3, forking my Rook
and Queen, and I wasn't sure how to best deal with that situation. Also,
Black has a firm grip on the b4-square, through his c5-pawn, Knight on c6,
and Bishop on e7. I wasn't sure if I should push a pawn, move my Rook or
Queen (to avoid the threat of a fork), or something else.} 19. a5 {Decided
on a4-a5, which prevents Nc6-a5. On the other hand, now my a1-Rook is tied
up with defending the a-pawn. Another move I considered was Ra1-b1,
allowing for b2-b4 since White now has majority on that square.

I was
happy to see that Stockfish also lists a4-a5 and Ra1-b1 as the two best
moves here. It seems I was thinking along the right track.} Rac8 20. Rfb1
{The idea, again, was to allow for b2-b4. I can't use the a1-Rook, since
it's busy defending the pawn on a5. But this opened the floodgate, and from
here on things only got worse.} cxd4 21. cxd4 {A mistake. I originally
thought of capturing with the f3-Knight, but didn't due to two reasons
(maybe one of which was legitimate). First, I was worried about ...Bh4 if
the f3-Knight left its post. Second, I somehow forgot about the c3-pawn,
and saw this continuation after 21.Nxd4:

21...Nxd4
22.Qxd4??
Bc5

winning my Queen (pinned to the King on g1). Obviously, this is a
non-issue after the correct 22.cxd4.

Nxd4 is the correct move. The text
loses the game.} (21. Nxd4 Nxd4 22. cxd4 (22. Qxd4 Bc5 {This was the line I
saw that ultimately stopped me from playing Nxd4. Obviously no reason to
recapture with the Queen here.}) 22. .. Rc7 {Stockfish has Black up by
about +0.5 here.}) 21. .. Bb4 {I had been concerned about the e7-Bishop
coming over to the h-file. This move took me by surprise. Now my a-pawn is
lost.} 22. Qd3 Nxa5 {The d7-Bishop nicely takes away the a4-square from my
Rook, otherwise I would have played Ra4 here.} 23. Bd1 {With ideas of going
to a4, forcing an exchange of Bishops. Stockfish says this is a bad idea,
and recommends Ng5 instead. I was considering something with my Knights on
the King-side, but couldn't find any promising lines.} Bb5 24. Qe3 {Only
square left for the Queen.} Nc4 {More pressure on the Queen.

Here it was
very frustrating to realize how impotent my two Rooks were, especially the
one stuck behind the b-pawn.} 25. Qf2 {Again, the only square left.} Qh6 {I
wondered what the idea was behind this move, completely overlooking the
fact that my f-pawn is now hanging.} 26. b3 {The next really bad move. Here
I completely forgot that I had intended for my Bishop to go to a4. This was
of course a desperate attempt of chasing away the Knight.

Stockfish
recommends Ne2 here, defending f4. But again, I didn't realize that the
pawn was hanging.} Na3 27. Rc1 Qxf4 {NOW it dawned on my that the pawn was
hanging.} 28. Rxc8 Rxc8 29. Qb2 {For a short moment I thought I would win a
piece. The Knight has no where to go. But this is in fact a blunder, and I
soon realized why.} Bc3 {First I thought that this didn't matter, that
after 30.Qxa3 Bxa1 31.Qxa1 I would have won the Knight and Bishop for my
Rook. Then I was dismayed to realize that 31...Rc1 was a killer move.} 30.
Qxa3 {Decided to go through with it anyway. My idea was that after 31...Rc1
I would play 32.Qa5, hoping for just enough time to start checking the
Black King and maybe get something out of that. Not sure exactly how I was
expecting that to happen, since 32...Rxd1 (which was the move I
anticipated) is a check. I suppose I must have thought I would be able to
block all checks, and then slip in a Qd8+ on my own. I obviously didn't
calculcate very deeply (read "not at all").} Bxa1 31. Qxa1 Rc1 32. Qa5
{Turns out Qa5 results in a mate in five for Black.} Qe3+ 33. Kh1 {It was
here I realized that mate could not be avoided. Decided to play it out
rather than resign.} Rxd1+ 34. Qe1 Rxe1+ 35. Nxe1 (35. Ng1 Rxg1#) 35. ..
Qxe1+ 36. Nf1 Qxf1# 0-1
