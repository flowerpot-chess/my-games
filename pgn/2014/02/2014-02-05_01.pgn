1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 {The Marshall Gambit of the Scandinavian Defense.} 3.
d4 {The Modern Variation.} c6 {The most common response by Black is
3...Nxd5, winning back the pawn, although White may gain some time by
chasing the Knight away via 4.c4.} 4. c4 {Having just read Nimzowitsch's
chapter on development, the center, and the downside on pawn-grabbing, I
decided to give c4 a try here rather than dxc6 (which, btw, is the move
Stockfish recommends).} cxd5 {The original Scandinavian Defense has now
transposed into the Panov-Botvinnik Attack variation of the Caro-Kann.} 5.
Nc3 {Again, choosing to develop the Knight rather than cxd5. After 5.cxd5
Nxd5, Black has a strong Knight on d5, and can follow up with e6. This way,
if 5...dxc4 6.Bxc4 White has a much stronger hold on the center.} (5. cxd5
Nxd5) 5. .. Nc6 6. Nf3 Bg4 7. cxd5 Nxd5 8. Qb3 {This move adds a second
attacker on the Knight on d5, and also threatens the b7-pawn. On the other
hand, it leaves the Knight on f3 with a single defender, the g2-pawn, so if
Black decides to exchange on f3 my King-side pawn structure will be messed
up. On the other hand, it would leave me with both Bishops, and I would
still have the dual threat in play.} Bxf3 9. gxf3 Nxc3 {9...Nb6 would have
neutralized both threats mentioned in prevoius comment.} 10. bxc3
{Recapturing with the Queen would be a mistake, since the d4-pawn would
fall (see variation). The text also keeps the threat of Qxb7 alive.} (10.
Qxc3 Nxd4 (10. .. Qxd4)) 10. .. Qb6 11. d5 {I'll leave it to Black to
initiate a Queen exchange, since it would have the added benefit (for
White) of connecting the Queen-side pawns.} Ne5 {The f3-pawn is hanging.}
12. Bb5+ {Hoping to get the King on the move, preventing future castling.
As a matter of fact, I can force Black to move his King, because after
...Nd7, blocking the check, I can follow up with Bxd7+. But I'd really
prefer to keep both my Bishops.} Kd8 (12. .. Nd7 13. Be3) 13. Be3 {Develops
the Bishop, attacks the Queen, and prevents ...Nxf3 for a while longer.
Once the Black Queen moves out of the way (and the White Bishop), the
threat of Qxb7 is reintroduced.} Qg6 14. Be2 {Protects the f3-pawn, and
opens up the b-file for the Queen. Stockfish recommends Queen-side castling
here, something I never considered - I was mainly concerned about
preventing ...Nxf3. See variation what would happen if Black went ahead
with that move after long-castling. Another option I considered was Kf2,
because of the additional benefit of connecting the Rooks. Downside is that
after Kf2 Black can answer with ...a6, chasing away my Bishop.} (14. O-O-O
14. .. Nxf3 15. Bc6 Qd6 (15. .. bxc6 16. dxc6+ Ke8 17. Qb7 {Threatening
Qd7#.}) 16. Bxb7 Rc8 (16. .. a5 17. Bb6+) (16. .. g6 17. Bxa8) (16. .. Rb8
17. Bxa7) 17. Bxc8 Kxc8) (14. Ke2 a6) 14. .. Rc8 {Probably a bad choice,
since it allows me to capture on b7. ...b7-b6 would have been better.
However, after ...b6 I could move my Queen to the a-file, threatening to
capture on a7 is the Black Rook leaves a8.} 15. Qxb7 {Wins a pawn, and
gives the Queen a very good position on the 7th rank.} Qd6 16. Qxa7
{According to Stockfish, Bxa7 is much stronger. Note that the seemingly
hanging pawn on d5 is poisoned. See ...Qxd5 variation.} Rb8 (16. .. Qxd5
17. Rd1 Qxd1+ 18. Bxd1) 17. f4 {Here I might have ended up making a good
move for the wrong reasons. At this point I really wanted to connect my two
Rooks, but was struggling with how to do it. Kd2 would be bad, since it
would allow ...Qxd5+. So f4 had two purposes: chasing away the Knight, but
also allowing f2-f3, and then Kf2 (if still possible). The obvious solution
to my problem, castling!, escaped me for another move.} Ng6 18. O-O {Here I
finally realized that castling was an option, and went for it. I was also
glad about the f4 move, since the Black Knight on g6 prevents ...Qg6+.} Nh4
{Threatens Qg6+ followed by Qg2# (see variation). This was immediately
clear to me, in part (I think) because of my bad loss on January 26, where
I had an identical pawn structure around my King, and Black delivered a
killer blow via Rg6+.} 19. f5 {Struggled a while to come up with a good
move to prevent the mate. Settled on this. Also considered moving the
f-Rook, which would allow my King an escape route, but that's still not an
attractive option since Black could go ahead with the attack and still
probably make considerable damage, if not material then definitely
positional. Note that the f5-pawn, while hanging, is also poisoned like its
d5 companion. See ...Nxf5 variation.} (19. Ba6 Qg6+ 20. Kh1 Qg2#) 19. ..
Rb2 {Losing move. Stockfish recommends ...Qc7 instead. In either case,
Black is in a really bad spot. His h8-Rook and Bishop are non-entities,
while all my pieces are active.} (19. .. Nxf5 20. Rab1 Rc8 (20. .. Rxb1 21.
Rxb1 {This is a mate in eight according to Stockfish. There's apparently no
way for Black to stop the Queen-side attack here. Black can throw in a
couple of spite checks, but that's it. The combination of Queen and Rook
and both Bishops is a tremendous force, with Black's Rook and Bishop
hopelessly undeveloped and out of the picture.}) 21. Bb6+ Qxb6 (21. .. Ke8
22. Bb5+ Qc6 23. Bxc6+ Rxc6 24. Qa8+ Kd7 25. Qxc6#) 22. Qxb6+) 20. Rab1
{The e2-Bishop is hanging to the Rook, but it would be a disaster for Black
to capture it (see variation). And the d5-pawn is still poisoned, so I
don't have to worry about Qxd5-Qg2#. (I just have to be careful to use the
b-Rook, not the f-Rook, to pin the Queen. Update: Over the board I was
afraid that after 20...Qxd5 21.Rfd1 Rxb1 my d1-Rook would be pinned, hence
the comment of using Rbd2. See variation why this turned out to be an
unwarranted concern.)} Nf3+ {Again, ...Qc7 would at least have put up some
fight.} (20. .. Rxe2 21. Bb6+ (21. Qa8+ Kd7 22. Rb7+ Qc7 23. Rxc7+ Kxc7 24.
Qc6+ Kb8 (24. .. Kd8 25. Bb6#) 25. Rb1+ Rb2 26. Rxb2#) 21. .. Kc8 (21. ..
Ke8 22. Qa8+ Kd7 23. Qd8#) 22. Qa8+ Qb8 23. Qc6+ Qc7 24. Qxc7#) (20. .. Qc7
21. Qa8+ Qc8 22. Qxc8+ Kxc8 23. Rxb2 Nxf5) (20. .. Qxd5 21. Rfd1 (21. Rbd1)
21. .. Rxb1 22. Bb6+ Rxb6 23. Qxb6+) 21. Bxf3 Qc7 22. Rxb2 {Qxc7+ is a more
precise move.} Qxa7 23. Bxa7 g6 {Here I considered the "lazy" approach, of
starting to push the a-pawn for promotion. Decided to go for mate instead.
The two pawns on d5 and f5 take away several escape squares for the Black
King, and the d5-pawn itself is immune from taking (by the King) thanks to
the f3-Bishop.} 24. Rb8+ Kc7 {Black resigned here.} 25. Rfb1 Bg7 26. R8b7+
Kd6 27. Bd4 {Takes away c5 and e5 as escape squares for the King. The
beautiful thing is that nothing changes after ...Bxd4 cxd4 - the pawn
serves the purpose just as well!} Bxd4 28. cxd4 Rc8 29. R1b6+ Rc6 30. Rxc6#
1-0
