1. e4 {Early morning Friend Mode game as White against Shredder 12.} g6 2.
d4 d6 3. Nc3 c6 4. Be3 Bg7 5. Qd2 {h6 is now a target.} Nd7 6. Nf3 b5 7.
Bd3 {Maybe a2-a3 is better, taking away the b4-square from Black. But with
the text I'm at least fully developed.} Ngf6 8. Bh6 {Again, a2-a3 is an
alternative. So is King-side castling, getting my house completely in order
before going on the attack.} Bxh6 9. Qxh6 Nb6 10. a4 {Not a2-a3, since that
leaves a4 for the Black Knight. I could also have kept my nerve, and played
Ng5.} (10. Ng5 {With Black's dark-squared Bishop off the board, this is a
very strong position for my Knight.} Rf8 11. O-O) 10. .. b4 11. Ne2 Bg4 12.
Ng5 a5 13. c3 {My reasoning here was that either Black will have to play
...bxc3 or ...b3. If the former I get the pawn off the board, if the latter
the b-pawn ends up in a weak spot. And if Black doesn't move his pawn at
all I'll play cxb4 next move. Here f2-f3 is probably a better choice,
chasing back the Bishop.} bxc3 14. Nxc3 {I recaptured with the wrong piece!
bxc3 is much better, and leaves the Knight available for offensive duties
on the King-side.} Nh5 {I'm now looking at g3. If I can move my e-pawn out
of the way, opening up the diagonal for my Bishop, maybe there's a chance
for something around f2 and f3?} 15. f3 (15. d5 cxd5 16. exd5 {Opens up the
center for my Bishop. With the Queen, Knight, and Bishop all focused on the
King-side, Black could be in trouble.} Bc8 17. O-O Nd7 18. Nxh7 Rg8 19. g4)
15. .. Be6 16. Nxe6 {My idea was that an exchange benefits me, since it
removes a defender of g3. But I'm not sure this is a good move in this
situation, it's probably better to leave the Knight on the board. He is
very strong on g5.} fxe6 17. O-O {Here I considered playing e4-e5, but
decided against it for the wrong reasons: I figured that after 17.e4-e5
dxe5 18.dxe5 my Bishop would be hanging to the Queen. But after 17...dxe5 I
could play 18.Bxg6+ instead. See variation.} (17. e5 dxe5 (17. .. Rf8 18.
Qxh7 Nf4 19. O-O-O) 18. Bxg6+ {Puts Black in a very bad spot, so
realistically he wouldn't play 18...dxe5.} hxg6 (18. .. Kd7 19. Bxh5) 19.
Qxh8+) 17. .. Nf6 18. Rad1 {I'm still thinking of opening up the center via
e4-e5, but want to strengthen my d-file first.} Rf8 19. Kh1 {In one line I
calculated Black would be able to play ...Qxd4+, so moving the King off
that diagonal. Now I think I'm finally ready to make a move in the center.
Stockfish says I should have played e4-e5 after all.} (19. e5 dxe5 20. dxe5
Qxd3 21. Kh1 Ng4 22. Qxf8+ Kxf8 23. Rxd3 Nxe5) 19. .. Rf7 20. e5 Nfd5
{Surprised me, I expected ...dxe5. But the Knight is free to move now that
the Rook is defending h7.} (20. .. dxe5 21. dxe5 Nfd5 22. Ne4 Qb8 23. Ng5
Qxe5 24. Nxf7 Kxf7 25. Qxh7+) 21. Ne4 {Leaves the a4-pawn hanging, but I
felt that it was better to bring my Knight over to the attack. Exchanging
Knights is bad here, since Black can just recapture with the b6-Knight.}
Rf4 22. Rfe1 {Preventing ..Ne3, forking my Rooks. Stockfish tells me I
shouldn't have worried about that, and played g2-g3 here instead.} (22. g3
Rf5 23. Qxh7 Kd7 {Why not ...Ne3? Is it a folly for Black to go hunting
Rooks when he should leave his Knight defending his King?} (23. .. Ne3 24.
g4 Nxf1 (24. .. Nxd1 25. exd6 Kd7 26. gxf5 gxf5 27. Nc5+ Kc8 28. dxe7 Qe8
29. Rxd1) 25. Qxg6+ Kd7 26. gxf5 exf5 27. Qxf5+ Kc7)) 22. .. Nxa4 23. Rb1
{Another bad move. At this point I shouldn't be concerned about protecting
my pawns. I should be attacking!} Qb6 24. exd6 Qxd4 25. Qxh7 {My Bishop is
hanging, but I decided to go for attack immediately. In hindsight, maybe
Bc2 is better here.} (25. Bc2 exd6 (25. .. Nab6 26. Qxh7 Qb4 27. Qxg6+ Kd7
28. Rbc1 Rh8 29. h3) 26. Rbd1 Qb4 27. Bxa4 Qxa4 28. Nxd6+ Ke7 29. Ne4 Rf7

27. Qxe6 Ra7 28. dxe7 Nxe7 29. Nf6+ {Rd1 is better here. See variation.}
Rxf6 30. Qxf6 Rd7 {Now White has to be careful not to be back rank mated.}
31. Ra1 {Qg7 is more forceful, since it threatens mate on g8. I did not see
that.} Qc2 32. Qf4 {Qg7 would still threaten mate.} Rb7 33. Rxa4 g5 34. Qe4
{Bad move. It would have been better for me to keep the Queen, so Qg4 here
is superior.} Qxe4 35. Rexe4 {Recaptured with the wrong Rook! Raxe4 creates
a battering ram against e7, which limits Black's options.} Rxb2 36. h3
{Here I was mostly concerned with making luft. But h2-h4 is better. From
here on I made a complete mess of things. My inexperience in handling these
types of situations was very evident.} Rb5 37. f4 gxf4 38. Rxf4 Nd5 39.
Rfd4 Kf7 40. Ra3 Rb4 41. Rxb4 axb4 42. Rb3 {At this point White's advantage
is completely gone, and Stockfish now evaluates Black's position to be much
better! White's King is ruefully inactive, and White will have a hard time
fending off the two pawns.} c5 43. Rf3+ Kg6 44. Rd3 Nc3 45. Rd6+ Kg5 46.
Rc6 Ne4 47. Rb6 Kf4 48. Kg1 Kg3 49. Kf1 Nc3 50. Rc6 Ne4 51. Ke2 Kxg2 52.
Ke3 Ng3 53. Rxc5 Kxh3 54. Rb5 b3 55. Rxb3 Kg4 {At this point I offered a
draw. Shredder did not accept the offer, and we played on for 15 or so
moves. I then offered a draw again, and this time the offer was
accepted.

Obviously a very disappointing result, seeing how I had a huge
advantage. In key moments I played too defensively, and let the advantage
slip away.} 1/2-1/2
