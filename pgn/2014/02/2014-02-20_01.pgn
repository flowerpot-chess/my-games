[Comment "The Critter engine was set to strength \"Similar to player\"."]

1. e4 {Playing Black against the Critter 1.2 engine set to strength
"Similar to the player". Have not played against this engine for a while.}
c5 {Decided to give the Sicilian another go.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 e6 4. O-O
Nge7 5. c3 d5 6. exd5 Qxd5 {Perhaps better to recapture with the e7-Knight?
On the other hand, the Knight on e7 also protects the Knight on c6, so
after ...Nxe5 Bxc6 forces me to recapture with the b-pawn, messing up my
pawn structure.} 7. Re1 a6 8. c4 Qd6 9. Ba4 Bd7 {Unpins the Knight.} 10.
Qe2 Nf5 {I plan to follow up with Nc6-d4, attacking the White Queen and
discovering an attack on the White Bishop. That in itself will not win any
material, but if the White Bishop leaves the d1-a4 diagonal I can play Nc2,
forking the White Rooks.} 11. d3 {Now the White Queen covers c2, so my
Knight-forking plans may have to be put on hold.} Ncd4 {Does it make a
difference which Knight I move to d4?} 12. Bxd7+ Qxd7 13. Qe4 {Blunder,
that allows me to for the Rooks after all.} Nc2 14. Ne5 Qc7 15. g4 Nfd4
{The a1-Rook isn't going anywhere, so I can move my Knight to safety.} 16.
Be3 Nxe1 {First of all, here I missed a nice tactic: ...Qxe5!. If White
recaptures (Qxe5) I can play ...Nf3+, forking the King and Queen. That nets
me a Knight in the exchange, and the White Rook on a1 is still
lost.

However, I didn't see that at all (shame on me). Instead I decided
to grab a Rook, and I decided on the e1-Rook. My thinking was that after
...Nxa1, my Knight can easily get stuck on a1. Its only escape square is
the c2-square it came from, so if White covers that square and moves his
Knight away my Knight will be trapped and left hanging for the Rook on
e1.

Stockfish actually agrees with me, and evaluates Black's position
after ...Nxe1 about +3 better than after ...Nxa1. But Qxe5 is stronger
still.

So I decided to consider my Knight as good as lost anyway, and
captured the more active Rook on e1 instead.} (16. .. Qxe5 17. Nd2 (17.
Qxe5 Nf3+ {Forks the King, Queen, and Rook!} 18. Kf1 Nxe5 19. Rc1 Nxa1 20.
Nd2) 17. .. Qxe4 18. dxe4 Be7 19. Bxd4 cxd4 20. Nf3 Rd8 {Notice how it's no
rush to grab one of the Rooks - White can't save both of them anyway.}) 17.
Bxd4 cxd4 {A blunder. Here I missed that ...Nc2 will win me the second Rook
as well!} (17. .. Nc2 18. Bc3 Nxa1 19. Qe2 Bd6) 18. Qxe1 {The exhange,
sloppy executed by both sides, concludes with Black winning a Rook for a
Knight.} Bd6 {Developing the Bishop and attacking the Knight.

Here I
also considered ...f7-f6, leaving the diagonal open for the Queen. I
thought that after Nf3 I could play ...Qf4, attacking both the Knight and
the pawn on g4. But White can then counter with Qxe6+. So then I considered
starting out by playing ...b2-b4 instead. After cxb4 and axb4 I could move
my Rook to a6, protecting e6 (of course, White has a move in between there,
which might trip up those plans). And if White instead plays c4-c5 his
c-pawn would be hanging for my Queen. Of course, White also has the option
of just leaving his c4-pawn be and play something else.

All in all, I
decided that Bd6 was the simpler move, with the most straight-forward
benefit: my Bishop gets developed. An additional benefit is that h2 is now
a target.} (18. .. b5 19. Qe4 {As I said in the comment after 18...Bd6:
White can just ignore my b-pawn and play something else, like this move
which activates the Queen and attacks my Rook.}) 19. Nf3 {Brings the Knight
to safety, and defends h2.} g5 {Here I had a decision to make. On the one
hand I don't like my King in the center (on the same file as the White
Queen to boot!), and would like to castle. On the other hand, my Bishop and
Queen are already zeroed in on the h2-pawn, and I wouldn't mind letting my
h-Rook stay where it is, and open up the h-file.

I decided to go for the
attack. ...g7-g5 blocks the g4-pawn, and allows me to force open the h-file
via ..h7-h5.

Note that the pawn is technically hanging to the Knight,
but after Nxg5 I can play ...Bxh2+. Alternatively I can still play
...h7-h5, forcing open the h-file anyway.} 20. Qe4 {Attacks the d4-pawn.}
(20. Nxg5 Bxh2+ 21. Kf1 h5 22. Nxe6 fxe6 23. Qxe6+ Qe7 24. Qxe7+ Kxe7 25.
Nd2 hxg4) 20. .. h5 {Also considered setting a trap, via 20...Rd8. Then
20.Qxd4 Bxh2+! wins the Queen.

Went ahead with h7-h5 instead, to stay on
the offensive.} 21. Qxd4 {To be honest, I didn't realize that Qxd4 would
also attack my h8-Rook until after the move was made.} (21. gxh5 Rxh5 22.

brings the a-Rook to d8 after all. Now the White Queen is in peril.} 22.
Kf1 {Now ...Bxh2 is not a check, so won't win the Queen.} Bf4 {Blocks the
White Queen from g4.} (22. .. hxg4 23. Qxg4) 23. Qa7 {Did not see this move
coming.} hxg4 {The Queen on a7 is no real threat, so decided to go ahead
with mission h-file.} 24. Nd4 Qd7 {Here I suddenly got cold feet regarding
the Queen on a7. So instead of playing the Rxh2 move I had been preparing I
instead open the way for the Bishop to block a check on b8 if
necessary.

...Rxh2 is the better move.} (24. .. Rxh2 25. Nd2 (25. a4
Rh1+ 26. Kg2 Rhh8 27. Kf1 Rh2) 25. .. Rh1+ 26. Kg2 Rxa1 27. Ne4) 25. Ne2 {A
blunder.} Qxd3 {Wins a pawn and pins the Knight.} 26. Qc5+ Kb8 27. Nc3 Qh3+
{Bad move. Rxh2 is a mate in five.} (27. .. Rxh2 28. f3 (28. a3 Rh1+ 29.

Bd2+ 29. Kd1 Be3+ {Here I thought I would win the Black Queen. I eventually
did, but at some cost. ...Bxc3+ is a stronger move, that also ends up
winning the Queen (see variation).} (29. .. Bxc3+ 30. Kc2 Rd2+ 31. Kb3 Bd4+
32. Ng3 Bxc5) 30. Nd4 Rxd4+ 31. Ke1 Rd1+ {Finally wins the Queen, but I
give up my Rook in the process.

Here I first considered ...Bxf2, because
it seemed to lead to mate. But in one of the lines I calculated I couldn't
find a way to mate White. Finally I decided to pretend I was in a real over
the board game with time controls, meaning I didn't have the luxury to
scrutinize each individual line for a way to mate, so I settled for the
Queen-for-a-Rook exchange instead.

It turns out that ...Bxf2 actually is
a forced mate in five! See variations.} (31. .. Bxf2+ 32. Ke2 {This line I
saw.} (32. Kxf2 Qxh2+ 33. Kf1 {This was the line I had problems with over
the board.} (33. Ke1 33. .. Qg1+ 34. Ke2 Rh2#) (33. Ke3 Qd2#) 33. .. Qh1+
