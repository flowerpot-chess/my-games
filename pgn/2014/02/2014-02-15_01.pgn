1. d4 {Early Saturday morning Friend Mode game as White against Shredder.
Decided to open with d4 for a change, since I don't have very much
experience playing that opening as White.} e6 2. c4 d5 {We've reached the
Queen's Gambit Declined, but in reversed move order.} 3. Nc3 c6 {This is
the Semi-Slav Defence. I've heard of it, but never played it. I got a lot
of help from 365chess.com's opening explorer for the first 10 moves or so
in this game.} 4. Nf3 dxc4 {From exploring the various lines, White will
typically win back the pawn at a later point.} 5. a4 {This is a move I
probably never would have thought of myself. I was considering to play
e2-e4 here, but decided to stick to one of the main lines.} (5. e4 b5 6.
Be2 Nf6 7. O-O Ba6) 5. .. Bb4 6. e3 b5 7. Bd2 a5 8. axb5 Bxc3 9. Bxc3 (9.
bxc3 cxb5 10. Be2 Nc6) 9. .. cxb5 10. b3 Bb7 11. bxc4 b4 12. Bb2 {I chose
Bb2 rather than Bd2 because I liked the thought of the Bishop barreling
down on the a1-h8 diagonal. As it turned out, this Bishop ended up getting
stuck here because of Black's advancing a- and b-pawns.} Nf6 13. Bd3 O-O
14. O-O Nbd7 15. Qc2 {When I played this move I wasn't fully aware of the
fact that I left my f3-Knight, under attack from the Bishop on b2, defended
only by the g-pawn.} Qc7 {Now the situation with my f3-Knight started to
concern me even more. After ...Ng4 my Knight on f3 is the only defender of
h2 against two attackers. And if White then plays Bxf3 I will lose a piece
in order to prevent mate on h2.

But I was overly concerned about this,
and should have taken more care of preventing Bxf3 in the first place.
After all, as long as my Knight is on f3 there is no threat on h2. See
comment after 16.h3.} 16. h3 {Takes away the g4-square from the Knight.
But, to continue the reasoning from the comment after 15...Qc7, a better
move would have been e3-e4, blocking the Bishop from capturing my Knight.
As long as my Knight is on f3 I don't have to worry too much about h2.

I
could also have played Qe2, but that would have wasted a tempo (the move
Qc2), and I would also give up the current potential threat of Bh7+ (maybe
after Ng5, if Black lets me keep my Knight).} Bxf3 17. gxf3 {Exposes my
King. There's no immediate threat, since Black has no pieces in the
vicinity that can take advantage of this at the moment.} Qc6 {Threatening
the f3-pawn.} 18. e4 {Spent a long time chosing between 18.e4, 18.d5, and
18.f4. Decided on this move, with the plan of following it up with
e4-e5.

Stockfish says f3-f4 is the stronger move.} (18. d5 exd5 19. cxd5
Qxd5 {I've lost a pawn, and f3 is still hanging!} (19. .. Qxc2 20. Bxc2
Nxd5 21. Ba4 (21. Be4 N7b6) 21. .. N7b6 22. Bc6 Rac8)) 18. .. a4 (18. .. e5
19. dxe5 Nh5 {This was the line I calculated for 18...e5 before I played
18.e4. I did not see any immediate threat from Black in this position, but
Stockfish says Black is +1 or more here.}) 19. e5 b3 20. Qe2 {After all
that, I ended up playing Qe2 after all! (See comment after 16.h3.)} Nh5 21.
Be4 {Seems almost too good to be true - will I really win Black's Rook this
easily?} Nf4 {No, of course not! The Knight moves in and threatens my Queen
in return, complicating the situation.

Although Stockfish says this is a
mistake, and that Black would have been better off just moving his Queen
out of the way, accepting the loss of his Rook for my Bishop. The text puts
white up almost +3.} 22. Qe3 {Spent a lot of time debating between this
move and 22.Bxc3. The problem is that 22...Nxe2 is a check, so I would lose
a tempo moving my King, allowing Black to play ...Rd8, saving both his
pieces. At that point my d4-pawn would be hanging to the Knight, and beyond
that point the calculations became too messy for me to handle.

With this
move I fully expected Black to play ...Nxh3+, grabbing a pawn and checking
my King. But after Kh2 Black would have another piece hanging.} Nxh3+ 23.
Kh2 Qxc4 24. Rfc1 {Stockfish says I should have grabbed the Knight on h3
instead. See variation.} (24. Kxh3 Rac8 25. Rg1 g6 26. Qh6 Rfd8 {I suppose
this is a reason why Stockfish wants me to go for Kxh3: it gets an
immediate attack going on the Black King.} (26. .. Qe2 27. Rg4 {Threatening
Rh4 and a mate on h7.} Rfe8 28. Rh4 Nf8 29. Ba3 Rc7 30. Kg2 {Does two
things: protects the pawn and opens up the h-file for the other Rook.} b2

Rxg6+ fxg6 29. Qxg6+ Kf8 30. Rg1) 24. .. Qb5 25. Bxa8 Rxa8 26. Kxh3 {White
wins a piece, but lost two pawns in the process.} Nb6 27. Qc3 Rb8 28. Qc7
{Threatening the Rook, and Black has to thread carefully now, since a back
rank mate is looming. For example, 28...Rc8?? 29.Qxc8+ Nxc8 30.Rxc8+ Qe8
31.Rxe8#

Stockfish suggests Qc6 instead, setting up a Queen exchange.
See variation.} (28. Qc6 Qxc6 29. Rxc6) 28. .. Rf8 29. Kg2 {Connecting the
King and the pawns. I plan to move my c-Rook to c5 or c6, and this move
limits the potential danger of ...Qe2.

Here my fingers twitched to play
Ba3, attacking the Rook on f8, but that gives Black ...b2!} Ra8 {A blunder.
Rc6 now wins the Knight. See variation.} 30. Qb7 {I didn't see the more
direct Rc6 move. My idea here was that after Qxa8, the Knight on b6 can't
recapture because of Rc8 which leads to mate. Basically just keeping the
pressure up, and eventually playing the Rook up the c-file.} (30. Rc6 h6
(30. .. Ra6 31. Qc8+ Nxc8 32. Rxc8+ Qe8 33. Rxe8#) (30. .. Nc4 31. Qc8+
Rxc8 32. Rxc8+ Qe8 33. Rxe8#) 31. Rxb6 Qd3) 30. .. h6 {Making luft.} 31.
Rc7 {Once again, Rc6 wins the Knight outright.} Qe2 {Bad move that
completely loses the game for Black. The Queen needed to stay around
defending, e.g. through Qa6. White has a hige advantage either way though,
so it may not have mattered much in practice.} 32. Rxf7 Kh8 33. Rxg7 Qd3
{Prevents the immediate Rh7+ and Qg7#. But ...Rg8 would have been a
stronger defense.} 34. Rc1 {Bad move. Rh1 is of course much better, in fact
a forced mate in six. I completely overlooked that, and was just focused on
getting my second rook to the 7th rank as well.} (34. Rh1 Nd7 35. Qxd7
Qxf3+ 36. Kxf3 Rf8+ 37. Rf7 Rxf7+ 38. Qxf7 a3 39. Rxh6#) 34. .. Nd7 {Black
is lost either way, but this move just expediates the process.} (34. ..
Qf5) 35. Qxd7 {Black resigned here. Black resigns} 1-0
