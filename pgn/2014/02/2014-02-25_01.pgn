[Comment "Friend Mode game, with handicap -201."]

1. e4 {Friend Mode game as White against Shredder 12. Handicap was -201 (or
something like that).} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Next time I play White I
should try something else than the Ruy Lopez.} Nge7 {Don't think I've ever
played against this defense in the Ruy Lopez.} 4. c3 {Also not sure if I've
ever played c3 in the Ruy Lopez before.} a6 5. Ba4 d6 6. O-O {Inconcistent?
After 4.c3 it is perhaps more natural to play 5.d4 directly? Or is it OK to
castle first?} Bd7 7. d4 Ng6 (7. .. exd4 8. cxd4 Ng6 9. Nc3) 8. Re1 {Maybe
8.d5 is better here.} Be7 9. Nbd2 {Again, d4-d5 is probably better. Here I
was concerned about developing my pieces. Also considered Be3 (which is
probably better than the text).} O-O 10. Nf1 {I've seen this in a couple of
openings and wanted to try it. Also gets the Knight out of the way of the
Bishop.

In hindsight I'm not very happy with this move. The Knight
became a non-issue on f1 for a long time, and I struggled with finding
anything useful for it to do.

Again, d4-d5 here would have been better.}
exd4 11. cxd4 Nh4 12. Nxh4 Bxh4 {Here I became concerned about Black
playing Bh3, and if gxh3 the Black Queen could swoop in with a check.} 13.
d5 {Finally I play d4-d5. Of course, now it's not as good as it would have
been before, since the e5-square is open for the Knight. And again I'm
inconsistent - before I was eager to develop my pieces (9.Nbd2), but here I
leave the Bishop on c1. Be3 would have been a good option.} Ne5 14. Bxd7
{Now I don't have to worry about ...Bh3 (not sure that was much of a threat
to begin with).} Qxd7 15. Bf4 {Kind of shortsighted move. The Bishop does
not have a good home on f4, since it's difficult to defend it there. On the
other hand, the Black Knight is strong on e4, and it doesn't hurt to evict
it from there.} Ng6 16. Qf3 {Another shortsighted move. Do I really want my
Queen to be stuck defending my Bishop? Better to just retreat the Bishop to
g3, and a possible exchange.} f5 17. e5 dxe5 18. Bxe5 Nxe5 19. Rxe5 {I'm
left with an isolated d-pawn.} Bf6 20. Re2 {Defends b2.} Rae8 21. Rxe8 Rxe8
22. Qb3 Qb5 23. Qxb5 axb5 24. Rc1 {Now if Black plays ...Bxb2 I can counter
with Rxc7.} Re7 25. b3 {Moving out of the way of the Bishop.} Bd4 26. Rd1
(26. Ng3 g6 27. Kf1 Bb6 28. Ne2 Rd7 29. Rd1 Kf7) 26. .. Bc5 27. Rd2 {To
prevent ...Re2.} Re1 28. g3 {To allow Kg2, unpinning the Knight.} Kf7 29.
Kg2 Ke7 {Heading for my d5-pawn. Not much I can do about that.} 30. h4 {By
vacating h2 I provide my Knight an outlet, e.g. Nh2-f3. My King also has a
fairly safe home, immune to the Black Bishop. On the other hand, we're
entering the end game, so I should perhaps be better off making my King
more active, as Black is currently doing.} Kd6 31. Nh2 Re5 32. Nf3 Rxd5 33.
Re2 {I do NOT want to trade off Rooks here, being a pawn down.} h6 34. Re8
{Heading for new hunting grounds on the 8th rank.} Bb4 35. Rg8 {The only
way for Black to safe a pawn here is to play ...Bc3. If ...g7-g5 White can
play Rg6+, winning the h-pawn.

I also considered Rd8+, but couldn't see
anything concrete coming out of that.

Another option here would have
been to play Kf1, making my King more active.} Bc3 {Necessary to save a
pawn.} 36. h5 {To allow Nh4.} Kc5 37. Nh4 f4 38. g4 Rd2 39. Ng6 {Another
alternative would have been Nf5-Nxg7.} Rxa2 40. Nxf4 c6 41. Ne6+ {Forks the
King and the g7-pawn.} Kb4 42. Nxg7 Be1 43. Rf8 {To defend f2. Stockfish
says this is a mistake, and that I should have played g4-g5 here. (I did
that next move instead.)} Kxb3 44. g5 {Here I saw a glimmer of hope. I'm
guaranteed to end up with a passed pawn here.} hxg5 45. h6 {Here I thought
I was in great shape. Black's pieces are far away. Especially the Rook has
no easy way to prevent my pawn from promoting.} Bc3 {Aha. Stops the pawn in
its tracks.} 46. Rg8 {Not sure what else to do. Considered playing
something like Nf5 or Nh5.} Bxg7 {A terrible blunder that loses the game
for Black.} 47. hxg7 {Now Black can't stop my pawn from promotion. 

If
Black's g-pawn had been on another file Black could at least play Ra4-Rg4.
Then after the pawn promotes Black could give up his Rook for the newly
promoted Queen. White would then be left with a Rook and a pawn, against
four pawns.

Note that capturing with the Rook would have been a mistake,
as it would allow the Black Rook entrance on the 8th rank.} Ra4 48. Re8 c5
49. g8=Q+ c4 50. Re5 {Black resigned here. I continued the line in Lucas
Chess against Critter, and ended up mating Black after another 10+ moves or
so.

This was another game where I played too passively. Throughout the
entire game I didn't have a single attacking plan on my own, but ended up
reacting to Black's move instead. Ended up with an isolated pawn that I
then lost. Black had a winning advantage, but threw it all away with the
46...Bxg7 move.

On the plus side, I don't think I made any horrible
blunders this time, like leaving any pieces hanging. 
And I think I made some decent decisions in the end game.

Black resigns} 1-0
