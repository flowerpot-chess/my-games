1. e4 {Friend mode game as Black against Shredder.} c5 {I want to get more
experience with the Sicilian.} 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nge2 d6 {Here I can basically
push any of the d-, e-, and g-pawns.Went for the d-pawn, for no particular
reason to be honest.} 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 g6 6. Bb5 Bd7 7. O-O Bg7 8. Be3 a6
9. Nxc6 bxc6 {Probably better to recapture with the Bishop. Now my a-pawn
is isolated, and my Rook is stuck defending it.} 10. Bc4 Nf6 11. f3 {Now
I'm concerned about White playing g2-g4. Is that a legitimate concern?} O-O
12. Qd2 (12. g4 {What would happen is White followed up with g2-g4?} Be6
{Nothing to be concerned about, says Stockfish.}) 12. .. a5 {To free up my
Rook. Stockfish recommends ...Qb8 here, which was actually another move I
was considering.} (12. .. Qb8 13. b3 Be6 14. Bxe6 fxe6 15. Na4 c5) 13. a4
Rb8 14. b3 Re8 {Here I was running short of ideas. I can't push the e-pawn,
since it leaves d6 hanging to the Queen. I didn't want to push the c-pawn,
because it weakens d5. And pushing the d-pawn loses material, if I
calculated correctly. (But I didn't! See variation.) Actually, Stockfish
says I should push the d-pawn. Again, see variation.} (14. .. c5 15. Rad1
Qb6 16. Nb5) (14. .. d5 15. exd5 Nxd5 {Not sure what I thought when I
calculated the d6-d5 line. Black is fine here. Yes, the d5-square is
attacked three times by White, but it is defended by the pawn on c6.} (15.
.. cxd5 16. Bb5) 16. Bd4 {This is the move Stockfish recommends for White
here.} (16. Nxd5 16. .. cxd5 17. Bxd5 Bxa1 {Hmm.}) (16. Bxd5 cxd5 17. Bd4)
16. .. Bxd4+ 17. Qxd4 Qb6) 15. f4 c5 {Pushing the c-pawn anyway. I want to
open up some space for my Bishop. ...d6-d5 is still a good alternative.}
16. f5 Bc6 {I probably should have captured the f-pawn instead.} 17. fxg6
hxg6 18. Bg5 e6 {A blunder. My idea was to block the c4-Bishop from f2, but
the text removes a vital defender of the f6-Knight. Another option I had
here was ...Rf8, adding back the Rook as a defender of f6. I rejected that
on the grounds of wasting a tempo moving the Rook back and forth like that.
Stockfish recommends ...Rb4. Not sure I understand that move.} (18. .. Rb4
19. Qd3 Rf8) 19. e5 {White plays a weak move in return. Qf2 is better.}
(19. Qf2 d5 20. Bd3 dxe4 21. Nxe4 Bxe4 22. Bxe4 c4 23. bxc4 Rb4 24. Bc6 Rf8
25. Bb5) 19. .. dxe5 20. Qxd8 Rbxd8 {Capture with the e-Rook or b-Rook?
Don't know if it matters much, but Stockfish recommended the e-Rook. It
kind of makes sense, since that would leave both my Rook on open or
half-open files. Over the board I didn't realize that my f6-Knight is now
attacked twice, and only defended once.} 21. Bb5 Bxb5 (21. .. Ne4 {The move
recommended by Stockfish here. I don't think I'd ever thought of this move
myself: My c6-Bishop is hanging, and the move opened up for the Bxd8.} 22.
Bxd8 Rxd8 23. Rfd1 Rb8 24. Bxc6 Nxc3 25. Rd7 {White only has a slight
advantage in this position, says Stockfish.}) 22. axb5 Ra8 {Another
blunder. Again, I didn't realize my Knight was in such great peril. The
purpose of the move was to defend the a-pawn, and remove the pin on the
Knight.} 23. Bxf6 Bxf6 24. Rxf6 {NOW the penny dropped.} Kg7 25. Ne4 Red8
26. Rff1 {Bad move. Raf1 would have kept the pressure on.} Rd4 27. Nxc5 Rc8
{My idea here is to win the c2-pawn. I fully expected the Knight to move
out of the way, and did not see White's good reply c2-c3.} 28. c4 {A
blunder. c2-c3 would have attacked my Rook, but the text loses the Knight
instead.} Rxc5 29. Rxa5 {White is up one pawn.} f5 {Want to tuck my King
away on f6.} 30. Ra7+ Kf6 31. b6 Rd8 {This is a losing move, says
Stockfish. White gains a huge advantage after 32.Rc1. Recommended move here
was ...Rd6.} (31. .. Rd6 32. Ra6 Rd2 33. b7 Rd8 34. Ra8 Rc7 35. Rxd8 Rxb7
36. Rb1) 32. Kf2 {White blunders in return.} (32. Rc1 Rb8 33. b4 Rcc8 34.
b7 Rc7 35. c5 e4 (35. .. Rcxb7 36. Rxb7 Rxb7 37. c6 Rb8 38. c7 Rc8 39. b5
e4 40. b6 Rh8 41. b7 Kg5 42. b8=Q Rxb8 43. cxb8=Q) 36. c6) 32. .. Rb8 33.
Rc7 Rxc7 34. bxc7 Rc8 35. b4 Ke7 {Want to bring my King over to help my
Rook with those pawns.} 36. c5 Kd7 {Here I should probably have captured
the c7-pawn instead.} 37. b5 {Bad move. Rd1+ is stronger.} Rxc7 {Better to
capture with the King.} 38. Rd1+ Kc8 39. c6 Kb8 {Bad move says Stockfish.
White can now play Rd6 and I'm in trouble. Better would be ...Ra7.} 40. Rd7
{Surely a blunder.} Rxd7 41. cxd7 Kc7 42. Kf3 Kxd7 43. Ke3 Kc7 44. Kd3 Kb6
45. Kc4 e4 46. g3 e5 47. h3 f4 48. gxf4 exf4 49. Kd4 e3 50. Kd3 Kxb5 51. h4
Kc5 52. Ke2 Kd5 53. Kf3 Ke5 54. Ke2 Kf5 {...Ke4 is more precise.} 55. Kf3
Ke5 56. Ke2 Kf5 {It's interesting how much clearer some things are in
post-game analysis. Here the board is screaming for ...Ke4, but instead I
play ...Kf5 and get awfully close to a three-fold repetition. To be honest,
I was aware of that risk during over the board, and even though I was in a
totally winning position here a draw somehow felt OK at the time,
considering how badly I had played. I was very much aware that the only
reason I was still alive at all was because of a series of bad moves from
Black.} 57. Kd3 Kg4 58. Kc3 Kxh4 59. Kc2 Kg3 60. Kd1 Kf2 {White resigns}
