[Comment "Critter strength set to \"Somewhat better\""]

1. e4 {Saturday night game as White against Critter 1.2, set to strength
"Somewhat better than player". Expected a hard time.} a6 {Did not expect
this!} 2. d4 b5 {This is apparently called the St George Defence.} 3. Nf3
{Not sure what to do, but normal development can't hurt, can it?} Bb7
{Attacking the e4-pawn.} 4. Bd3 {The normal Nc3 is risky with the Black
pawn on b5.} Nf6 {A second attacker on e4.} 5. Nbd2 {Since the Knight's
normal home on c3 is shaky, I figured this was a good way of backing up the
e4-pawn. The alternative would have been Qe2. I could also have advanced
the pawn to e5, but then Black has a good square on d5 for his Knight.} e6
6. O-O c5 7. dxc5 {Thought a long time here. Also considered c2-c3, and
e4-e5.} Bxc5 8. e5 {Gives d5 to the Black Knight, but also gives place for
my own Knight on e4.} Nd5 9. Ne4 Qb6 10. Qd2 {Wasn't really sure what to
play. Was toying with the option of blaying b2-b3, fianchettoing my Bishop,
and wanted to take away the c3-square from the Knight. The whole premise
was a bit shaky, since Black could play ...b5-b4.} O-O 11. Nf6+ {Here I
realized that all of Black's pieces were on the Queen-side, where as most
of my pieces where aimed towards the King-side. Attack!} gxf6 (11. .. Nxf6

Ng5 {Again threatening Qh7#. And in fact, Black can't prevent mate. There
are no pieces around to defend, and all he can do is throw in a couple of
spite checks. He can also move away the Rook, giving the King an escape
square on f8, but that just results in mate on f7 instead.} Bxf2+ 14. Rxf2
Qxf2+ 15. Kxf2 Rd8 16. Qxh7+ Kf8 17. Qxf7# {Not at all what I expected from
Critter by going up one level in strength. This almost reminded me of a
game from Chernev's "Logical Chess".} 1-0
