[Comment "Critter set to strength \"Similar to player\""]

1. c4 {Friday evening game as White against Critter 1.2, set to strength
"Similar to player". Critter plays the English opening.} Nf6 2. Nc3 c5
{After reading a little on wikipedia I went for the symmetrical line.} 3.
e4 Nc6 4. Nge2 e6 5. d4 cxd4 6. Nxd4 Bb4 {Pinning the Knight. Black is now
threatening ...Nxe4.} 7. f3 {Stops ...Nxe4.} O-O 8. Be3 d5 9. cxd5 exd5 10.
Nxc6 bxc6 11. e5 Re8 {Now if White plays 12.exf6 Black can counter with
12...Rxe3+. And also, the e5-pawn is now hanging.} 12. Qd4 c5 {I'm very
happy I saw this move.} 13. Qd2 (13. Qf4 {If White tries to hang on to the
e-pawn...} Nh5 {...Nh5 traps the Queen, sort of.} 14. Qg5 Qxg5 15. Bxg5
Rxe5+ 16. Kf2 Rxg5 {Black wins a piece in the exchange, and White's King is
on the move.}) 13. .. Rxe5 {Here I could have played ...d5-d4, forking the
Bishop and Knight. But I decided to capture the e-pawn first, pinning the
Bishop to the King. Then follow up with ...d5-d4 in my next move.} 14. Rd1
{A better way for White to get his Rook to d1: castle Queen-side. That
brings the King out of immediate danger, and unpins the Bishop.} Qe7 {Now I
got nervous about ...d5-d4, with my Queen facing White's Queen and Rook on
the d-file. This way I also pile on the pressure on White's King.

Btw,
note how my two pawns in the center are completely unassailable!

Also
note that my back rank is still safe. If the d-file opens up, Qd8+ is not a
disaster, since my Queen, e-Rook, and Knight all cover e8.} 15. Kf2
{White's King gives in under the pressure.} (15. Nxd5 Bxd2+ 16. Kf2 (16.
Kxd2 Rxd5+ 17. Ke2 Ba6+ 18. Kf2 Rxd1 19. Bxa6 Rxh1) 16. .. Bxe3+ 17. Nxe3
Rxe3) 15. .. d4 {Finally.

Another idea here was that ...Ne4+ would fork
the King and Queen, hadn't it been for that pesky pawn on c3. So I toyed
with the idea of playing ...Bg4, or ...Re4, to see if White would bite. I
decided against it, since if White *didn't* bite, and e.g. moved his King
or Queen away, I would be left in a rather precarious situation.

Along
the same lines, I thought about playing ...Ne4+ anyway, and after cxe4
follow up with ...Qf6+. But I couldn't find a way to make that attack pan
out, giving back enough compensation for the Knight sacrifice.} 16. Bxd4
cxd4 17. a3 Bc5 {...dxc3 is tempting, but the text keeps up the pressure on
White instead.} (17. .. dxc3 18. Qd8+ Ne8 19. Qxe7 Bxe7 20. bxc3 Rb8 21.
Rd2 Rb3) 18. Ne2 {Stockfish actually says White is better off with Qxd4.}
(18. Qxd4 Bxd4+ 19. Rxd4 Qc5 20. Nb5 Ba6 21. b4 Qc8) 18. .. d3+ 19. Ke1
dxe2 20. Qd8+ Ne8 21. Qxe7 exd1=Q+ {Here I thought it was clever to get the
Rook off the board before I recapture the Queen. But this is actually a
mistake; dxf1Q+ is even stronger, and leads to mate in seven. See
variation.} (21. .. exf1=Q+ 22. Kd2 (22. Kxf1 Ba6+ 23. Rd3 Bxd3#) 22. ..
Qe2+ 23. Kc3 Bxe7 24. b4 Re3+ 25. Rd3 Rxd3+ 26. Kc4 Qc2+ 27. Kb5 Rd5#) 22.
Kxd1 Bxe7 23. Bd3 Bf5 {Decided to trade away pieces.} 24. Bxf5 Rxf5 25. Re1
Rd8 {White resigned here. I did set up this position after the game, to see
how I would manage to finish the game off. After flailing about for a while
I finally managed to mate White in move 47. White resigns} 0-1
