1. e4 {Quick game as Black on my phone while waiting for Ludvig, who was
playing with his class mates after a Friday movie night at Maya Lin
School.} e5 2. Qf3 {This is apparently the "Napoleon's Opening" (C20).} Nf6
3. h4 d5 4. exd5 Nxd5 5. c3 g6 6. d3 Bg7 {Fianchettoing my Bishop. This
Bishop ended up being a non-entity throughout the game.} 7. g3 O-O 8. Bg5
Qd6 9. c4 Nb4 10. Nc3 Nc2+ {The classic King-Rook fork on c2.} 11. Kd2 Nxa1
12. Nd5 {Qd1 here had won the Knight on a1, since it has no where to go.}
Nc6 13. Kd1 Nd4 14. Qe4 c6 (14. .. Qa6 15. Nc3 Nac2 {The Knight is immune
from the King thanks to the other Knight on d4.

Btw, that fianchettoed
Bishop on g7 keeps the e5-pawn safe from the Queen, so it did something
good after all (at least in this variation).}) 15. Bg2 {Weird move, that
leaves the Knight hanging.} cxd5 16. cxd5 Qc5 17. Qe3 Qc2+ 18. Ke1 Bg4
{Threatening Qd1#.} 19. Qd2 Qb1+ 20. Qc1 {The only move for White. (Qd1
loses immediately to ...Qxd1#.)} Qxd3 {I'm not interested in trading
Queens.} 21. Qxa1 Nc2# {To be honest, I played this move for the King-Queen
fork (again on c2!), and was a little surprised when the phone told me I
had won on check mate.} 0-1
