1. e4 {Friend Mode game as Black against Shredder.} c5 {Another attempt at
the Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ {The Canal-Sokolosky Attack, also known as
the Moscow Variation.} Nc6 {Three options to block the check: Bd7, Nd7, and
Nc6. Bd7 is the most common move, more or less forcing an exhange of
Bishops on d7. I like my Bishops, so I wanted to try something else. Went
for Nc6, accepting my double-pawns in exchange for having both my Bishops.}
4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O e5 {Grabbing hold of the center.} 6. c3 f5 {Probably a
bad choice, seeing how all my pieces are yet undeveloped. I still wanted to
try it, seeing how I have had success with open f-files in a couple of
games lately.} 7. d3 Be7 {My main motivation is to take away the g5-square
from White while at the same time developing a piece. On the other hand,
the move is somewhat inconsistent - I played f5 since I liked the idea of
an open f-file, and here I have the option of actually opening the f-file
via fxe5.} 8. Nbd2 Nf6 9. Qa4 {Threatening Qxc3+.} fxe4 {The idea of the
text is to free up the c8-Bishop, who was stuck defending the f5-pawn. The
text allows me to play Bd7 , to protect the c3-pawn. Stockfish suggests
Qb6. I contemplated that move, but figured that Nc4 would force me to move
the Queen again. I also rejected Qc7, since I thought my Queen would be
rather boxed in that way. Maybe Qc7-Qb7 would have been OK?} (9. .. Qb6 10.
Nc4 {This was the move that stopped me from playing 9..Qb6. This is not a
problem at all says Stockfish (see continuation of the variation).} Qb5 11.
Qb3 (11. Qxb5 cxb5 {Probably an ill-advised exchange for White, since it
undoubles my pawns.} 12. Ncd2 c4 13. dxc4 fxe4 14. Ng5 bxc4 15. Ngxe4 d5)
11. .. fxe4 12. dxe4 Nxe4 13. Re1 Nf6) 10. dxe4 Bd7 11. Qc4 {Prevents
castling.} d5 {I really want to castle. Stockfish says I should have played
something like Qb8 here instead. And looking at the evaluations, this is
the point where it tipped from being slightly better for Black to being
slightly better for White.} 12. Qe2 {Here it dawned on me that my previous
move left the e5-pawn hanging to the f3-Knight. Try as I might, I could
come up with a way to save that pawn.} Qc7 13. exd5 cxd5 14. Nxe5 O-O 15.
Nxd7 Qxd7 16. Re1 Rae8 17. Qe6+ Qxe6 18. Rxe6 Bd8 {Bad move. See variations
for better alternatives.} (18. .. Ng4 19. Nf3 Nxf2 20. Re5 (20. Kxf2 Bh4+
21. Kg1 (21. g3 Rxe6 22. gxh4 Ref6 23. Be3 Rxf3+ 24. Ke2) 21. .. Rxe6) 20.
.. Nd3 21. Rxd5 c4 {Black is still a pawn down, but Stockfish evaluates
this position to roughly equal.}) (18. .. Bd6 {I dismissed this move
outright since the Bishop is seemingly hanging. But in practice it's not,
because of the back rank mate on e1.} 19. Rxe8 Rxe8 20. Nf3 (20. Kf1 {The
best move for White here according to Stockfish. Looks odd, what about
...Bxh2?} Bxh2 21. g3 {Aha, the Bishop is trapped. I should have seen that,
I've been bitten by that before!} Ng4 22. Nf3 Rf8 23. Bf4 h6 24. Kg2 Rxf4
25. gxf4 Bxf4 26. Rd1) 20. .. Rb8) 19. Rxe8 Rxe8 20. Nf3 {Stopping
...Re1#.} Bb6 {Not really sure what I was thinking here, other than being
concerned about my pawns on c5 and a7 after White plays Be3.} 21. Be3 {Of
course, White can play Be3 anyway, pinning me down.} Ng4 22. Re1 Nxe3 23.
Rxe3 Rxe3 24. fxe3 c4 25. Kf2 Kf7 {Stockfish has wanted me to play Kf7 for
the last couple of moves. It's high time to get the King active.} 26. h3 h5
{At this point I had basically no idea how to play. This is an area of the
game where I'm really lacking in experience and understanding.} 27. b3 cxb3
{Stockfish says I should have focused on making my King more active,
through Ke6. Basically every move I actually make turns the position
slightly worse for Black.} 28. axb3 Kf6 29. Nd4 g5 30. g4 hxg4 31. hxg4 Ke5
32. Kf3 Kf6 {Bad move says Stockfish. My King was fine where it was, and I
should have played a7-a6.} 33. Nc6 a5 34. e4 dxe4+ {Really bad move. ...Ke5
would have been better, locking down that side of the board.} 35. Kxe4 Kg6
36. Ne5+ Kh6 {...Kf6 loses the Bishop after Nd7+. Either way, the White
King will now get up and close to my g-pawn, which is bound to fall.} 37.
Kf5 {I resigned here. I can't prevent White from Nf7-Nxg5. This was another
of those games where I quickly found myself dominated by the opponent,
constantly on the defensive without any offensive ideas of my own. A couple
of inaccurate moves in the opening resulted in a lost pawn, and it was all
downhill from there. The next time I'm faced with the Moscow Variation I
will give 3.Bd7 a try instead. Black resigns} *
