1. e4 {Early morning Friend Mode game as White against Shredder.} c5 2. Nf3
d6 {Considered playing the Moscow Variation that I lost against yesterday.}
3. d4 {Decided to stick with something closer to the main line.} Nf6 4. Nc3
cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nc6 6. Bc4 e6 7. Bb3 {Not sure I'll be playing this move
again. The Bishop ended up not doing much at all on b3, and it's easy for
Black to pick it off after ...Na5. Better here is to castle, or develop the
other Bishop, e.g. to d3.

On the other hand, I'm not sure what the
future is for the Bishop on c4 either. Back it up via b2-b3? And I also
have the option of exchanging Black's c6-Knight for my d4-Knight. That way
the Bishop may be OK on b3, and perhaps eventually on a2, making room for
the b2-pawn to advance.} a6 8. Be3 {See comment after previous move. Here I
could have played Nxc6, giving my light-squared Bishop a more hopeful
future.} Na5 9. Qe2 Qc7 10. O-O-O {Not sure why I opted to castle on the
Queen-side, considering there's where Black is gathering his forces. From
this point on I'm more or less stuck in permament defence.} b5 11. g4 b4
12. Na4 {I'm already falling behind. g4-g5 would probaby have been better,
countering Black's attack on my Knight with an attack of my own.} Be7 13.
f3 {Here I realized that my e4-pawn was hanging, so decided to back it up.
See variation for what Stockfish suggests instead.} (13. Nb6 Nxb3+ (13. ..
Qxb6 {Why not ...Qxb6 here?} 14. Ba4+ Bd7 15. Nxe6 Qb7 16. Bxd7+ Qxd7 17.

slightly better position?}) 14. Nxb3 Rb8 15. Nxc8 Rxc8) 13. .. O-O 14. g5
{Stockfish wants me to play Kb1 instead, which I suppose is a normal move
after having castled long.} Nd7 15. f4 {Half-hearted attempt of a pawn
storm? Bad move that leaves the e4-pawn vulnerable again.} Nxb3+ 16. axb3
(16. Nxb3 Qc6 {My a4-Knight is lost.}) 16. .. Bb7 17. Qd3 {Stockfish wants
me to give up the e4-pawn, and play f4-f5 instead, something I actually
considered. I guess that's something that comes with experience, seeing
when it's worth defending a pawn and when it's better to just let it fall.}
(17. f5 Bxe4 18. fxe6 {Stockfish doesn't even want me to bother saving my
Rook!} Bxh1 19. exd7 Be4 20. Bf4 Qb7 {Backing up the hanging e4-Bishop.}

the e4-pawn falls anyway, and White's position has become much worse in the
process.} 21. Rhf1 {Passive move. Wanted to get my Rook off h1, unpinning
my Knight. Decided to place it on f1 so that it defends the Knight, so that
my Queen would get more freedom to move around.} (21. Rxd8+ Rxd8 22. Rd1

(22. Rxd8+ Rxd8 23. Ne5) 22. .. Bd5 23. h4 {A desperate attempt of getting
something going on the King-side. I'm muh too late though.} a4 24. bxa4
Rxa4 25. Nb3 {Nb1 would have been better. Still a hopeless situation
though.} c4 26. Nd2 b3 27. c3 {Nb1 is better.} Ra2 {Bad move by Black, who
should have played Ra1+ here.} 28. Nb1 Be4 29. Na3 {The idea was to trap
the Knight. It's a terrible move on many accounts. Most of all because it
leads to a mate in two (that Black missed, see variation). Also because I
can't get to the Rook anyway: the King is prevented from reaching it thanks
to the Bishop on e4. And also because the Knight can be picked off by the
other Bishop, on e7.} Rxd1+ (29. .. Ra1+ 30. Nb1 Rxb1#) 30. Rxd1 Bxa3 31.
