1. d4 Nf6 2. Bd2 g6 {Wanted to try a Queen's Pawn Indian opening for the
first time.} 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e3 d5 6. h3 a6 7. Be2 Nc6 8. O-O Qd6
{Preparing for e7-e5.} 9. Re1 e5 {After 9.Re1 I wondered if I had to
counter that Rook with a Rook on my own on the e-file. Decided it was not
necesary.} 10. a3 {Probably a mistake. Seems like a random move to me.}
exd4 {Also considered e5-e4, which is what Stockfish recommends. Decided to
continue with my original plan of opening up things in the middle.} 11. Na2
{Another weird move by White. e3xd4 or Nf3xd4 would be expected here.} Ne4
12. Nb4 {White simply refuses to take back the pawn on d4.} Nxd2 {The
Knight on e4 was nice, but still felt it was a good idea to exchange it for
the Bishop, before the Bishop could swing into action, e.g. on b4 (after
that square has been vacated by the Knight).

Another good thing about getting the dark-squared Bishop off the board is 
that it makes my own King safer. In the last phase of the game I didn't 
have to worry about the Bishop as a threat, penetrating through the open 
diagonals around my King. I particularly noticed this in the last part of 
the game: White still had his light-squared Bishop on the board, but I never 
felt I had to worry about it as a threat. This is something I will keep in 
mind for future games in which I play an Indian defense (or end up with the 
same defense around my King).} 13. Nxd2 {Probably the wrong
piece to recapture with. Qxe2 is more natural, and activates the Queen
rather than shutting the Queen in. Also, the Queen on d2 would add a second
defender to the e3-pawn.} dxe3 14. fxe3 Bxb2 {Black is now two pawns
up.

I also considered Ne2-f5-g3, but felt the text was more direct, with
more immediate advantages.

Another motif I started thinking about around
here was Qg3, followed by Bxh3. I even toyed with the idea of sacrificing
the Bishop on h3. I decided to hold off on both ideas until I could pack
more punch behind the attack The Bishop on c8 hasn't developed yet, but it
is still quite powerful in its current position. (After Qg3, White can for
example play Nf1 or Bg4, neutralizing the threat, and I'm not left with
much.)} (14. .. Qg3 15. Nf1 (15. Bg4 Bxg4 16. Qxg4 Qxg4 17. hxg4)) 15. Rb1
(15. Ra2 Bc3 16. Nxc6 bxc6) 15. .. Bxa3 {Black is now three pawns up! Now
I'd like to get the Bishop to the c5 square, attacking and pinning the
e3-pawn.} 16. c3 {Allows me to exchange Knights, which I don't mind doing,
being up three pawns. It will also grant my Bishop access to the coveted
c5-square.} Nxb4 17. Nf3 {Another odd move by White. Why not cxb4, taking
back the lost piece? He will still lose the pawn, after ...Bxb4, but surely
that's better than the text?} Nc6 {Moving the Knight to safety, and opening
up to road for the Bishop.} 18. c4 Bc5 {Another alternative is dxc4,
opening up for a Queen exchange. Being up three pawns and a Bishop,
exchanges obviously favors Black, but I prefer to keep my Queen because I
think I'm very close to starting a strong attack on the King.} 19. Qb3
{Stops ...Bxe3.} Re8 {Adds a second attack of e3.} 20. Nd4 Nxd4 {Here I
missed a nice tactic winning the White Queen, shown to me by Stockfish in
post-game analysis. A shame, I need to be better at seeing those.

The
text isn't bad, obvoiusly, but not as good as winning the Queen...} (20. ..
Rxe3! {Is this an example of an X-ray attack? The way that the c5-Bishop is
practically defending e3, even though there's a Knight in the way.} 21.
Qxe3 {The alternatives are even worse for White.} Bxd4 22. Bf3 Bxe3+ 23.
Rxe3) 21. exd4 Bxd4+ 22. Kh1 {White resigned here.} Re3 {Preparing for that
Qg3 move that I described earlier. I figured it was time to pull the
trigger on that idea.} 23. Bd3 Qg3 24. Rxe3 Bxe3 25. cxd5 Bxh3 {The Bishop
springs into action at last!} 26. Qc2 Bg4 {Threatening Qh4#.} 27. Qxc7 {Now
...Qh4+ would be met by Qh2.} Qxc7 28. Rb3 Qc1+ {Here I for some reason
missed that I could move the Queen back to g3, and the original plan of
mating on h4 would be unstoppable. Mate in two, in other words. Instead I
went for a slightly more longwinded mate.} 29. Bf1 Qxf1+ 30. Kh2 Qf4+ 31.
g3 (31. Kh1 Qh6#) 31. .. Qf2+ 32. Kh1 Qg1# {In summary: It was fun to play
a Queen's Pawn Indian opening. I think I played a solid game, without too
many mistakes. On the other hand, White made it easy for me by one weak
move after another, so it wasn't particularly difficult to stay on the
right track in this one. I'm pleased with the way I saw the Qg3 attack
fairly early on, but held it off until I felt I had enough power behind the
punch.

I started the game on Saturday morning (Feb 1). Had to stop after 8.0-0, and 
the rest of the game was played on Sunday morning (Feb 2).} 0-1
