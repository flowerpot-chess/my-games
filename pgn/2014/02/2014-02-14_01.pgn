1. b3 {Friend Mode game as Black against Shredder. White plays the
Nimzowitsch-Larsen attack. I've never seen that one before.} e5 2. Bb2 d6
{3.Nc6 is another option. Maybe even 3.e4?} 3. e3 Nf6 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Nf3 O-O
6. h3 e4 {Chase away the Knight, and follow up with 7...d5.} 7. Nh2 d5 8.
Ng4 Be6 9. Nxf6+ (9. Ne5 c6 10. d4 Ne8 11. Ne2 f6 12. Nf4) 9. .. Bxf6 10.
Ba3 Be7 {Here I could also just have moved my Rook to e8. The reason I
didn't do that was that I didn't want the Black Bishop to stay on a3,
dominating that diagonal. On the other hand, Black self-pinned his Knight
to the Rook, so it would probably have been better to move the Rook after
all. If Black moves his Rook out of the pin, then I can always play ...Be7
later.} 11. Bxe7 Qxe7 12. Qh5 {Threatening Nxd5, winning a pawn.} c6
{Protecting d5, completing the pawn chain, and unfortunately also limiting
the options for my Bishop.} 13. g3 Nd7 {Connecting the Rooks. The Knight
could continue to f6, or maybe e5 at some point (not now, because it would
be hanging to the Queen).} 14. Bg2 {Looked strange (to me) at first to
place his Bishop there, because it has no where to go. But perhaps f2-f3 at
some point will open things up? Or if Black can undermine the pawn chain
from the other end?} f5 {Backing up e4, I suppose, but also further
limiting the options for my Bishop.} 15. a3 c5 16. Qh4 (16. O-O-O 16. .. d4

cxd3 Bxb3) (16. Nb5 Nf6 17. Qd1) 16. .. Qxh4 17. gxh4 {Figured that a Queen
exchange would benefit me here, because of the resulting pawn structure on
the King side.} Ne5 18. Nb5 {Threatening a fork on c7.} Rf7 {I can't play
something like ...Rac8, because my a7-pawn would be hanging.} 19. b4 b6
(19. .. a6 20. Nd6 Rc7 21. bxc5 Nd7 (21. .. Rxc5 22. d4 exd3 23. cxd3 Rc7)
22. d4 exd3 23. cxd3 Nxc5 24. Rb1 b5) 20. Rd1 a6 {To chase away the Knight,
and free up my a8-Rook which has been stuck on defensive duties, protecting
the a-pawn.} 21. Nc3 {If 21.Nd6 then 21...Rd8 traps the Knight.} d4 {Here I
also considered Nh6, threatening the h4-pawn. Then after h4-h5 I could play
Nh4, followed by Nf3+. But that doesn't really lead to anything. After Bxf3
exf3 White would have exchanged his inactive Bishop for my pretty good
Knight, and my pawn center would be messed up. Alternatively, after Ke2 my
Knight would have to retreat to h4, and then what?} (21. .. Ng6 22. h5

exf3 {Black is all of a sudden much worse off.}) 22. Na4 (22. exd4 cxd4 23.
Na4 Rc8 24. Nxb6 Rxc2) 22. .. d3 {A great square for the d-pawn. How will
White ever dislodge from d3? (And it ended up taking away a crucial escape
square from the Black King in the end.)} 23. c3 (23. cxd3 23. .. Nxd3+ 24.

finally gets a chance to leap into action, and what an entrance it is! (But
it should really thank the d-pawn for its heroic stroll up the board.)} 24.
Nxb6 Rb8 25. bxc5 (25. Rb1 Bc2 26. Ra1 Rxb6 27. h5 {This line is better for
White than what was played, but Black is still winning.}) 25. .. Bxd1 26.
Kxd1 Rc7 27. Kc1 {Strange move, that seals the deal.} Rxc5 28. Rf1 Rxb6
{Apparently ...Rb5 is one move faster to mate.} 29. f3 {Makes it a mate in
two.} Rcb5 30. a4 Rb1# 0-1
