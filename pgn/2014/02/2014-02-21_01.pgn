[Comment "Critter set to strength similar to player"]

1. e4 {Early morning game as White against Critter 1.2. Critter was set to
strength "Similar to player".} c5 2. Nf3 Qa5 {The Mongoose Variation of the
Sicilian. I've never seen that one before.} 3. Nc3 {Develops the Knight and
unpins the d-pawn.} g6 4. d4 Nf6 5. Bd2 {Unpins the Knight, stopping
...Kxe4. I was also considering the more direct way of protecting e4: Bd3.}
cxd4 6. Nxd4 Qb6 7. Be3 {Here I completely missed that th b2-pawn is
hanging, and was only concerned with protecting my Knight. I *was*
considering Nb3, which would have saved the pawn, but purely to get the
Knight to safety. I rejected that move because I preferred to have my
Knight in the center, even though I instead had to move my Bishop
again.

However, it turns out that ...Qxb2 is bad for Black. See
continuation.} Qxb2 {I was dismayed that I hadn't noticed the hanging pawn.
However, this is a bad move for Black. See continuation.} 8. Ndb5 {First of
all, Black has to be careful now not to get his Queen trapped. Also, White
is threatening Nc7+ at some point, forking the King and Rook. That's not
immediately doable, since Black can counter with Qxc3+.} e5 {Blunder.
Allows White to trap the Queen.} 9. Rb1 {The Queen has no where to go!}
Qxb1 10. Qxb1 {Recapturing with the Queen or with the Knight? I chose the
Queen, since I wanted my Knight to remain active in the center.} Na6 11.
Bc4 {My idea here is to develop the Bishop, allowing me to castle, and also
to zero in on f7 which could become a target, e.g. after Qb3 and/or Nd6 (at
some point when the f8-Bishop is not covering d6.

Bg5 is a stronger move
here (see variation).} (11. Bg5 Ng8 12. Qd1 h6 13. Qd5 hxg5 (13. .. Bb4 14.

Be7 15. Qxh8 Kf8) 11. .. Ng4 12. O-O {Here I considered Nd5, to be followed
up by N(either one)c7+. That wasn't possible before since Black's Knight on
f6 covered d5. I decided to castle instead so that my Rook would already be
on the f-file should Black decide to exchange Bishop for Rook on e3,
opening up the f-file.

Nd5 is the stronger move. I don't think there's a
way for Black to save his Rook in that line.} (12. Nd5 Nxe3 13. fxe3 Bc5
(13. .. Bb4+ 14. Nxb4 O-O {Removes the fork.} 15. Nxa6 bxa6 16. Nc7 {The
Rook is trapped anyway.} Bb7 17. Nxa8 Bxa8) 14. Ndc7+ Nxc7 15. Nxc7+ Ke7
16. Nxa8 b6) 12. .. Be7 13. Nd5 Bd8 {Stops Nc7.} 14. Qd1 {Here I strongly
considered Nd6+, forcing the King to move. Ultimately decided against it in
favor of building up more pressure for a more effective attack.

With the
text I was hoping for Black to retreat his Knight to f6. See variation for
what I had in mind.

Either way, White is obviously winning. Black has
lost his Queen, and White's pieces are all active, where as the bulk of
Black's pieces are on the 8th rank.} (14. Nd6+ Kf8 15. h3 Nxe3 (15. .. Be7

Nf6 {This would be a bad mistake by Black, and is actually a mate in four
(I did not see that in my over the board calculation).} 15. Nxf6+ {This was
the line I calculated. See Nd6+ variation for the mate in four.} (15. Nd6+

Kd8 17. Nxf7+ Ke8) 17. Qf3 {Here I thought that the dual threat of Qxf6 and
Qxf7# if Black moves his Bishop would be too much for Black. However, Black
could play Ke7 here, addressing both threats. I did not see that move over
the board. See continuation for what post-game analysis says.} Ke7 18. Bxa6

15. h3 {I was adamant of forcing that Knight to f6.} Nxe3 {Of course, the
Knight doesn't *have* to go to f6...} 16. fxe3 O-O {Here it was clear that
my build-up had been too slow, allowing Black to castle. Nd6+ earlier would
have prevented that.

White is still clearly winning, obvoiusly, but
could have played sharper.} 17. Nd6 Nc5 18. Nf6+ Bxf6 19. Rxf6 Kg7 20. Qf3
Ne6 21. Rxf7+ Rxf7 22. Qxf7+ {Mate is now unavoidable.} Kh8 {...Kh6 would
have made White work a little harder for the mate.} 23. Qxg6 {Threatening
Nf7#. And if Black plays ...Ng5 (covering f7) then Qg8#.} Rb8 24. Nf7# 1-0
