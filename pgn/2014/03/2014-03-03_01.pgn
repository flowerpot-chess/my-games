1. e4 {Quick game as White against my phone, while taking a dump.} e5 2. f4
d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. Nc3 Qc5 5. Nf3 exf4 6. d4 Qb6 7. Bc4 Be6 8. Qe2 {Same
move as against Stockfish yesterday, pinning the Bishop.} Nd7 {Bad move.
...Bf8-e7 would have unpinned the Bishop. Now the Bishop will fall to my
pawn.} 9. d5 Nc5 10. dxe6 fxe6 11. Nd5 {Taking advantage of the pawn now
being pinned.} Qc6 {Blunder, that allows the Queen to be pinned to the
King...} 12. Bxf4 {...but I completely missed that and developed my other
Bishop instead. Here I should have played Bc4-b5, pinning, and winning, the
Queen. (Ditto for the next couple of moves.)} Bd6 13. Bxd6 cxd6 14. O-O
O-O-O {Goodbye, pin-that-I-missed.} 15. Nc3 e5 16. Nb5 a6 17. Na7+ {But I
win the Queen anyway!} Kd7 18. Nxc6 Kxc6 19. Rad1 e4 20. Ne5+ {Taking
advantage of another pin.} dxe5 {...but Black doesn't realize (or care)
that the pawn is pinned.} 21. Rxd8 h6 22. Bxg8 {Here I missed a mate in
five (see variation). But winning a piece is not so bad.} (22. Rc8+ Kb6 23.

the start of a mating sequence.)} Kc7 24. Rxh8 g6 25. Rh7+ Kd6 26. Bxe4
