[Comment "Stockfish playing on level 5"]

1. e4 {Quick Sunday night game as White against Stockfish (level 5). Played
on the computer only, using Blitz 5/20 mode.} e5 {I wanted to play the
King's Gambit, so I forced Stockfish to play e5.} 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d5 4.

{...Qe7 would have been better for Black.} 9. Bxe6 fxe6 10. O-O Nc6 {Again,
...Qe7 would have been better, this time to back up the hanging pawn.} 11.
Qxe6 Qf6 12. Qc4 {I'm not interested in trading Queens here.} Nh6 13. Ne4
Qf5 14. Nxd6 Qg6 {Another bad move. Why not recapture the Knight on d6?}
15. d5 {Perhaps not the best move here. Nxb7, for example, is simpler,
saving the Knight and grabbing another pawn.} cxd6 {This was the move I was
planning on, but Black could also have recaptured with his Queen, which is
something I didn't consider.} 16. dxc6 bxc6 17. Qxc6 {This was the line I
calculated before playing 15.d5.} Rd8 18. Bxf4 (18. Ng5 {This is what
Stockfish recommends here.} d5 (18. .. Qxg5 19. Bxf4 Qg6 20. Bxh6+ Qf6 (20.

what I would have played had Black played ...gxh6.} (21. Nh4+ {But this is
the stronger line, with a mate in four.}) 21. .. Ke7 22. Qxh7+) 21. Bg5
{Skewering the Queen and Rook. The Bishop itself is protected by the
Knight.} (21. Rae1 {This is what Stockfish recommends. (For good reasons -
it's a mate in six.)}) 21. .. Qf7 22. Bxd8 Kg8 23. Bxa5 {Not to win the
pawn, as much as to clear the 8th rank for my Queen to attack the King.}
