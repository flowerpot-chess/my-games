[Comment "The Toga engine set to strength \"Somewhat better\"."]

1. e4 {Game as White against the Toga engine, another of the default
engines in Lucas Chess. Wanted to try the King's Gambit again, since the
other engines in Lucas Chess have played badly in that opening.} e5 2. f4
Nc6 3. Nf3 exf4 4. d4 {In my last game (against Rybka) I played Nc3 here.
That got a "?!" from Stockfish, so tried d2-d4 instead.} Nf6 {Attacking the
e4-pawn.} 5. Qe2 Bb4+ 6. c3 (6. Bd2 Bxd2+ 7. Nbxd2 O-O 8. d5 Ne7 9. O-O-O
{Stockfish evaluates this position to about +1.3 for Black, who is a pawn
up.}) 6. .. Be7 7. Bxf4 (7. e5 Nh5 8. d5 Bh4+ 9. Kd1 (9. g3 fxg3 10. hxg3
Nxg3 11. Qh2 g5 12. dxc6 Nxh1+ 13. Nxh4 gxh4 14. Qxh1 dxc6) 9. .. O-O 10.
dxc6 dxc6+ 11. Nbd2 (11. Bd2)) 7. .. O-O 8. Qc2 {Opens up for my Bishop,
while still protecting e4.} d5 9. e5 {Leaves a whole on e4 for the Black
Knight, but I couldn't come up with a better move.} (9. Bd3 dxe4 10. Bxe4
Nxe4 11. Qxe4 Re8 12. O-O Bd6 13. Ne5 Bxe5 14. dxe5 {Even in material, but
Stockfish evaluates this position to +1.3 for Black.}) 9. .. Ne4 10. Nbd2
{Saw a chance of exchanging Black's good Knight for my yet undeveloped
one.} Nxd2 (10. .. f5 11. h4 (11. Nxe4?? fxe4 {Leaves two pieces hanging:
the Bishop and the Knight.}) 11. .. Na5 12. b4 Nc4 13. Nxc4 dxc4 14. Bxc4+)
11. Qxd2 {Is recapturing with the Bishop better?} Bg4 12. Qf2 f6 13. O-O-O
{Here I got nervous about leaving the King on the e-file, as it looks like
it could be about to open up.} fxe5 14. Bxe5 {Must recapture with the
Bishop, since it is hanging to the Rook.} Nxe5 15. dxe5 Rf4 16. Rd4 {Here I
thought I could force an exchange of Rooks.} Bc5 {Completely missed this
move from Black. It's not the first time I line up major pieces like that,
I must pay more attention to this.} 17. Qd2 {Luckily, my last move wasn't a
complete disaster, thanks to the move Qd2, attacking the Black Rook in
return.} Rxf3 18. gxf3 Bxd4 19. cxd4 {Here I had a choice of which Bishop
to capture. Decided on cxd4, to connect my two center pawns. Either way I
will end up losing the exchange by one pawn.} (19. fxg4 Bxe5) 19. .. Bxf3
{Concludes the exchange. Black won a pawn. On the other hand, White has a
passed pawn (which turned out to be important...).} 20. Bg2 {Suggesting an
exchange of Bishops.} Bg4 21. Rg1 {Moves my Rook of the white diagonal,
with the potential of a discovered attack on the Bishop. I was thinking
that, if Black leaves his Bishop on g4, I could play Bxd5+, winning a pawn
in the exchange. But that doesn't work out well, because Black can continue
with ...Qxa2.} c6 22. Qe3 {Will allow my Bishop to go after Black's Bishop
again.} (22. Bxd5+?? {Now the aforementioned plan would have been
disastrous.} cxd5 23. Rxg4 Qc8+ {Forks the King and Rook.}) 22. .. Qh4
{Attacks my h-pawn.} 23. Qf4 {Defends the pawn, and pins the Bishop.} h5
24. Rf1 (24. h3 {Does not win the Bishop.} Rf8 25. Qe3 Be6) 24. .. Qe7 (24.
.. a6 25. h3 {With the Rook on f1, h2-h3 now wins the Bishop. The move
...Ra8-f8 from the previous line does not work here, since White can just
capture on f8.}) 25. Bf3 {Here I thought I had been clever, and would win
the h5-pawn (after the hanging Bishop moves away).} Rf8 {That ...Rf8 move
again!} 26. Qe3 Qh4 {Now my h-pawn is lost.} 27. Be2 (27. Qe2 Qg5+ 28. Kd1
Qf5 29. Bxg4 Qxf1+ 30. Qxf1 Rxf1+) 27. .. Rxf1+ 28. Bxf1 Qxh2 {Black is now
two pawns up.} 29. Bd3 {Looking to go to g6. Then Black would have to worry
about a back rank mate, and the Bishop on g6 also protects the e8
promotion-square for the passed e-pawn.} Qh1+ (29. .. a6 30. Bg6 a5) 30.
Kc2 Qa1 {A blunder that completely turns the tables on Black.} (30. .. Qg2+
31. Kc3 Be6 32. Qd2 Qg4) 31. e6 {It will now be difficult for Black to stop
the e-pawn.} Bd1+ 32. Kd2 {I didn't want to play Kc3 because I was nervous
about being driven into the hord of pawns waiting for my on the Queen side.
According to Stockfish Kc3 is a much stronger move though.} Ba4 (32. .. Bg4
33. e7 Qxb2+ 34. Bc2 Qb4+ 35. Kc1 Bd7 36. e8=Q+ Bxe8 37. Qxe8+ Qf8 38. Bh7+
Kxh7 39. Qxf8) 33. e7 Qxb2+ 34. Ke1 Qa1+ 35. Kf2 Qxa2+ 36. Kg3 {Not Kf3
because I didn't want to allow the Bishop to check me. (Stockfish says it
doesn't matter.)} h4+ 37. Kh3 {Staying on the third rank, to not allow
Black any unblockable checks.} Qg2+ {All Black has left now are a couple of
spite checks.} 38. Kxg2 h3+ 39. Kxh3 {The Toga engine resigned here. I
wanted to play on though, to practice my mating skills.} g6 40. Qe6+ Kg7
41. Qxg6+ Kh8 42. Qh7# {e7-e8Q# another alternative. The Toga engine played
the King's Gambit much better than the other engines so far (on the
"Somewhat better" level). In this game Black was winning (up two pawns,
with a better position), but made the losing move 30...Qa1. On my own part,
I made a couple of weak moves, and was mostly lucky they didn't turn out to
be out-right blunders.} 1-0
