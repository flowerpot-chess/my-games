[Comment "Rybka set to strength \"Somewhat better\""]

1. e4 {Monday evening game as White against Rybka, set to strength
"Somewhat better". Configured to play 1.e4 e5 since I wanted to play more
King's Gambit games.} e5 2. f4 Nc6 {A new variation that I haven't seen
before.} 3. Nf3 exf4 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bd6 {Black sets himself up for a
pawn-fork on e5.} 6. d4 O-O 7. O-O {I somehow missed the forking move
e4-e5. I saw it immediately after I castled.} Na5 8. Bd3 c5 9. e5 {Black
kindly allows me to fork him anyway.} c4 {...c5xd4 would have been better.}
(9. .. cxd4 10. Ne2 Bxe5 11. Nxe5 d6 12. Nf3 {White is up a piece, but
Black has a three pawn advantage. Stockfish evaluates this position to
about +3 for White.}) 10. Be2 b5 11. exd6 b4 12. Na4 (12. Nb5 Bb7 13. Nc7
Rc8 14. Bxf4) 12. .. Nd5 13. Ne5 f6 14. Bf3 {Now if ...fxe5 White can
counter with Bxd5+, forking the King and the Rook.} Bb7 15. Nc5 Nb6 16.
Bxb7 f5 {Strange move, that, apart from the piece I just won, also allows
me to win the Rook for my Bishop. Black should simply have recaptured with
the Knight.} 17. Bxa8 Qxa8 18. Bxf4 Qc8 19. Qf3 Nc6 20. Nxc6 {Exchanging
Knights is good for White, who is already up a lot of material.} dxc6 21.
a3 bxa3 22. Rxa3 {Threatening Rxa7, getting the Rook onto the 7th rank.}
Rf7 23. Re3 {I plan to follow up with Rfe1, for an attack on e8.} Nd5 24.
Re5 Qf8 25. Rfe1 (25. d7 Nf6 26. Ne6 Nxd7 27. Nxf8 Rxf8 28. Qxc6 Nf6 29.
Qxc4+) 25. .. a6 26. Re8 {Pinning the Queen.} Nxf4 27. Qxf4 {The pin isn't
going away, so I can simply recapture.} a5 28. Rxf8+ Rxf8 29. Re7 {Getting
the Rook onto the 7th rank after all. This is a mate in four, but I'm not
aware of that.} h6 30. Qe5 {This was actually the correct move, and it is
now mate in three. I made it for the wrong reasons though. My plan was to
work around the pawn, and get my Queen to g6, alternatively to e6 depending
on what Black plays.} Rf6 31. Re8+ {The mate in three has now turned into
mate in six (it'll become even worse).} (31. Qxf6! {Sacrifices the Queen
for a quick mate.} gxf6 32. d7 {I hadn't exactly forgotten about the pawn,
but thought I could mate Black without an extra Queen. That's true, of
course, but sometimes getting that extra Queen is a faster way to mate -
good to remember.} c3 33. d8=R#) 31. .. Kh7 32. Qe7 Rxd6 33. Qxd6 a4 34.
Qf8 (34. Re7 a3 35. Qg3 axb2 36. Qxg7#) 34. .. Kg6 35. Re7 Kh5 36. Qxf5+ g5
37. Re6 (37. Re3 a3 38. Rh3#) 37. .. c3 38. Qf3+ {Missing Qh3#!} (38. Qh3#)
38. .. g4 39. Qf5+ Kh4 40. g3+ {Missing Rxh6#!} (40. Rxh6#) 40. .. Kh3 41.
Qh5# {Finally.} 1-0
