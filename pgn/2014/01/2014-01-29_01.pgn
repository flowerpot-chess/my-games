1. e4 c5 {I wanted to try the Sicilian as Black, so I forced White to play
e4.} 2. Nc3 {The closed Sicilian.} Nc6 3. Nf3 g6 {I was already lost and
uncertain what to do. Got this move from 365chess.com's opening explorer -
it is the most common move in their database for this position. Stockfish
recommends e5 - I will try that next time.} 4. h4 {Black is completely
veering off the main lines now.} h5 {Did not want to let the White pawn
continue to h5. Stockfish recommends Ng8 or Bf7 here.} 5. d4 cxd4 6. Nd5
{This move surprised me. I was expecting Nxd4.} e6 {To chase away the
Knight.} 7. Nf4 {According to Stockfish, White is not much worse off by
moving Qe2 instead, seemingly sacrificing the Knight. I don't understand
why thi is - should probably investigate a couple of lines around that
idea.} Nf6 {I'm still kind of lost in the opening, but figured a normal,
developing move would be fine. I'm not sure what to do with my pawns,
especially the e-pawn and d-pawn.} 8. e5 Nxe5 9. Nxe5 Qa5+ 10. c3 Qxe5+ 11.
Qe2 Qxe2+ {Seemed to be the best choice, considering the situation with the
d4 and c3 pawns.} 12. Kxe2 {Probably the worst possible piece to recapture
with.} dxc3 {Missed a small tactic here: e6-e5 first, to chase away the
Knight, then dxc3.} 13. Nd3 {Well, White decided to move his Knight anyway,
allowing my pawn to continue on his rampage. This seems to be a common
problem with Stockfish on low levels - I've seen the same behavior in
previous games as well.} cxb2 {The only concern was after White recaptures
with his Bishop, I'm forced to move Bf8-g7 since the Knight is hanging (and
moving the Knight hangs the Rook). On the other hand, I was planning to
play Bg7 anyway.} 14. Nxb2 Bg7 {Stockfish wants me to play b7-b6 here, then
Bg7. I reversed the order of those moves.} 15. Nd1 b6 {My idea is Bh3+, in
the remote possibility that White leaves his King where it is. Then I could
exchange Bishops (being up three pawns in material). Also opens up for
Bc8-b7. In either case, I plan to follow up with Ra8-c8.} 16. Ke1 Nd5 {I
thought long and hard before this move. I have three options: Bb7, giving
the a8-Rook access to the open c-file. Or castle, bringing the h8-Rook into
the game. Or force some action by moving my Knight, discovering an attack
on the Rook on a1. I decided against the first option since I was worried
about White moving his Bishop to a3, which would prevent me from castling.
Was leaning towards castling, but decided to go for an attack instead.} 17.
Nb2 {Bad move. Rb1 would have been better.} Bc3+ 18. Kd1 Bb7 {Starting a
zig-zag journey to a4+. White would be forced to capture with the Knight,
and I win a Rook for a Bishop.} 19. Be2 Bc6 20. Rh3 Ba4+ 21. Nxa4 Bxa1
{Mission completed. I'm up two pawns, and have a Rook for a Bishop. On the
other hand, White has both his Bishops, and they should be strong in this
open game, so that is making me a little nervous.} 22. Bg5 O-O {Stockfish
wants me to play Rc8. In hindsight that would probably have been the better
choice, since Ba6 would prevent me from playing it later.} 23. Bb5 {White
is threatening my d7-pawn, and I can't find a good way of defending it. For
example: 23...f6 24.Bxd7 fxg5 25.Bxe6+ Kh2 26.Bxd5 nets two pawns for White
in the exchange. And 26...Rd8 would be followed by Rd3, saving the White
Bishop.

And d6 doesn't really work either: 23...d6 27.Be7 Rc8 (or Rb8)
28.Bxd6.

And if I let White capture on d7, my Rooks are severly cramped
by the two Bishops.

The above were my in-game notes. In analysis,
Stockfish showed me a line where it turns out that I missed. See
variation.} a6 {Lets White take the pawn. I plan to follow up 24.Bxd7 with
24...Ra7. That traps the Bishop - the best White can hope for is exchanging
it for my Knight. I'll gladly take that exchange.} (23. .. Rac8 24. Bxd7 {A
mistake, as shown (by Stockfish) in the following.} Rcd8! {I actually
looked at this line during the game, but stopped at this point. My thinking
was that I was already up so much in material that I could afford giving up
my Rook for a Bishop. But I didn't follow the line to its conclusion. See
continuation.} 25. Bxd8 Rxd8 26. Bc6 {Has to move the Bishop, otherwise
it's lost. The Knigh can't protect it.} Nb4+ 27. Kc1 Nxc6) 24. Bxd7 Ra7
{Rc8 would have been better, as shown by the line above.} 25. Bf6 {An
inexplicable move. White is giving away his Bishop.} Nxf6 26. Nxb6 Rb7 {See
variation for a better move, found by Stockfish.} (26. .. Nxd7 {To be
honest, I missed that the Bishop on d7 was attacked by my Knight. The
continuation of this line shows why White cannot recapture.} 27. Nxd7
Rxd7+) 27. Rd3 Rxb6 28. Ba4 Ng4 {Threatening a fork on f2.} 29. Ke1 Rb2 30.
a3 {White resigned here.} Rc8 {Stockfish suggests Rxf2 instead. I wanted to
bring the second Rook into the attack.} 31. f3 Rc1+ 32. Bd1 Nf2 33. Rd8+
Kg7 34. f4 Rxd1+ 35. Rxd1 Nxd1 36. Kxd1 Ra2 {Will get rid of the h-pawn,
and march my pawn to promotion. There's possibly (probably?) a way to mate
White without a Queen, but this seemed the most straightforward way (to
me).} (36. .. Rxg2 {This variation shows a mate in 11 that Stockfish
found.} 37. Ke1 Ra2 38. a4 Bf6 39. a5 Bxh4+ 40. Kd1 Rg2 41. f5 exf5 42. Kc1
Bg3 43. Kb1 h4 44. Ka1 h3 45. Kb1 h2 46. Ka1 h1=Q#) 37. a4 Rxa4 38. Ke2 Rd4
{Boxing in the King. And my Rook is untouchable, thanks to the Bishop on
a1.} 39. f5 a5 40. f6+ Kxf6 41. Kf3 a4 42. Ke2 a3 43. g4 a2 44. Kf2 Bc3 45.
g5+ Kg7 46. Ke3 a1=Q 47. Kf3 Qh1+ (47. .. Qf1+ {Slightly sharper way to
mate.} 48. Kg3 (48. Ke3 Rd3+ 49. Ke4 Qf3#) 48. .. Be1+ 49. Kh2 Rxh4#) 48.
Ke3 Qe4+ 49. Kf2 Rd2+ 50. Kg3 Qg4# 0-1
