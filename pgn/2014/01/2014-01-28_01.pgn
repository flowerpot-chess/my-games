1. e4 Nc6 {The Nimzowitsch defense.} 2. d4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Bg5 {Pinning
the Knight, so that it cannot capture e4.

Stockfish wants me to play
d4-d5 here, with e4-e5 as a runner-up move.} h6 5. Bxf6 {Don't think I'll
play this way (Bc1-g5) again. I'd rather keep both my Bishops. But
retreating the Bishop here does not feel right.

On the other hand, I'm
about to build up a pawn chain on the dark squares, so this Bishop might
have been rather weak anyway.} Qxf6 6. e5 {Stockfish wants me to continue
develop my pieces instead, via Nc3.} Qe7 7. c3 {Completing the pawn chain.
All the pawns are on dark squares, which is OK since I exchanged my
dark-squared Bishop.

This was also one of Stockfish's candidate moves,
btw, but it rated Nc3 slightly higher.} d6 8. Bb5 {Pinning the other
Knight, effectively removing an attacker from e5.} f6 {Adds a second
attacker of e5. Now if Black plays ...a6 I'll have to exchange my other
Bishop as well, since after Ba4 and ...b5 the Bishop must leave the
diagonal, freeing up the Knight. Same if Black unpins the Knight via Bd7
(which is what Stockfish recommended instead of this move).

Btw, the
same pawn structure appeared in the previous game as well, with White's
e5-pawn facing a barrage of Black pawns on d6, e6, and f6.} 9. Nh4 {A weak
move. I'm aiming for g6, which would pin the Queen and the Rook, but Black
can stop the Knight in its tracks through ...Qf7, leaving me with a Knight
on an awkward square. Also, this leaves the e5-pawn with a single defender.
The pawn is not in danger yet, because if Black takes the Knight moves to
g6.

Stockfish wants me to capture the d-pawn. The next time this pawn
structure appears I will go ahead and capture!} Qf7 {The expected move,
neutralizing my Knight.} 10. Qe2 {My idea was to add a second defender to
e5, now that the Knight is sulking on h4.} g5 (10. .. fxe5 11. dxe5 dxe5
12. Qxe5) 11. Nf3 {A sad retreat.

Stockfish wants me to Sacrifice the
Knight, by exd6 here. I don't understand why.} g4 12. Nh4 {Back to h4?! Nd2
was also an option (and is what Stockfish recommends), but I wanted to save
that square for the b1-Knight. It wasn't until after the move that I
realized that the Knight is now stuck on h4. It has no safe square to move
to. One option would be g2-g3, clearing the g2-square for the Knight.} dxe5
{Stockfish has recommended fxe5 for Black the last couple of moves. Here
Black captures with the d-pawn instead.} 13. dxe5 h5 14. Bxc6+ {Exchanging
my second Bishop, forcing a double-pawn on the c-file. The c6-pawn, in
particular, is a nice target for the Queen.} bxc6 15. Nd2 {Developing the
Knight.} Be7 16. Qe4 {This move serves two purposes: it threatens a
devastating attack on c6, which would bag the Black Rook, and it also
allows the sad h4-Knight to jump into action on g6.} O-O {Black leaves the
c6-pawn hanging, but now taking it won't result in a check.} 17. Ng6 {See
Qg6+ variation for the line Stockfish suggests here.} (17. Qg6+ Qxg6 18.
Nxg6 Rf7 19. Nxe7+ Rxe7 20. exf6 Rf7 21. Ne4) 17. .. Rb8 {Bad move. Gives
White a Rook for a Knight.} 18. Nxf8 f5 19. Qxc6 Qxf8 {Leaves the c7-pawn
hanging, but White's b2-pawn is also hanging.} 20. Nb3 Rb6 {Hands me the
c7-pawn.} 21. Qxc7 Bb7 {Now I have to be careful that I don't get my Queen
trapped.} 22. O-O {Briefly considered castling Queen-side, because of those
advanced Black pawns on the King-side. On the other hand, Black's Rook,
dark-squared Bishop, and Queen, are all aimed toward the Queen-side, so
King-side it is.} Bd8 23. Qd7 {Not many squares to pick from. Note that Qc4
would have been very bad, after ...Ba6.} Bg5 24. Rad1 {Getting a Rook on
the open d-file. Stockfish wanted me to move the other Rook though.} Bd5
25. Qxa7 {Here Stockfish wants me to play Rd1xd5, exchanging my Rook for
the Bishop. I actually considered this, but only very briefly. See
variation for Stockfish's line.} (25. Rxd5 exd5 26. f4 gxf3 27. Qxd5+ Qf7
28. Qxf3 {White is up three pawns.}) 25. .. Rb5 26. Qa6 Bxb3 {Starts an
ill-advised exchange for Black.} 27. Qxb5 {Note that it would be mistake to
just capture the Bishop: 27.axb3 Rxe5} Bxd1 28. Rxd1 Kf7 29. Qd7+
{Considered starting pushing my a-pawn, but went for the attack instead. I
expected Black to exhange Queens, via ...Qe7.} Kg8 30. Qxe6+ {Again setting
up a Queen exchange.} Kh8 {Black wants to keep his Queen.} 31. Rd7 g3 32.
hxg3 {Took with the h-pawn rather than the f-pawn, so as to not open up the
f-file unnecessarily for the Black Queen.} Qg8 33. Qxf5 h4 34. gxh4 Qg6
{Black has given up.} 35. Qxg6 Be3 {f2xe3 would lead to stalemate!} 36.
Qe8# {(Rh7# would have been prettier.)} 1-0
