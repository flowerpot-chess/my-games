1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Ne4 {The Mokele Mbembe variation of the Alkhine defence. I
played against this on January 18. In that game I answered with 3.d3,
chasing away the Knight. In this game I decided to try something else.} 3.
d4 {In hindsight this is a rather silly move. I could have reached this
pawn-position using d2-d3-d4 just as well. I would spend an extra move, but
Black is spending that move moving his Knight for the third time.} Nc6 4.
Nf3 (4. Bd3 d5 5. f3 {Traps the Knight!} Nc5 6. dxc5 Nxe5) 4. .. d5 {Hmm,
all of a sudden that Knight is looking awfully strong. See 4.Bd3 variation
for what Stockfish suggests instead of my 4.Nf3 move.} 5. Bb5 {Stockfish
wants me to play 5.c2-c3.} a6 6. Ba4 b5 7. Bb3 a5 8. a3 {Again Stockfish
suggests c2-c3, giving the Bishop an escape square on c2. I wanted the
Bishop on a2, however, since I've seen many great examples of how powerful
the Bishop can be on that diagonal, especially if Black castles Kingside
(which seems likely).} Rb8 9. c3 a4 10. Ba2 {Stockfish wants the Bishop on
c2. That makes sense, since Black will presumably play e7-e6 sometime soon,
which will block the a2-g8 diagonal. My plan is to try to remove those
blocking pawns during the course of the game. This almost worked out too!
It turns out there was a chance for the Bishop to play a decisive role from
its a2-position later in the game, but I blundered it away.} e6 {The
aforementioned e7-e6 move. Black's own light-squared Bishop is pretty
blocked too.} 11. Qd3 {Don't remember the exact thought behind this move.
At this point I was definitely thinking about how to get rid of the
e4-Bishop.} Be7 12. O-O f5 13. Ne1 {The thought behind this move was that
after Nb1-Nd2-Nxe4, Black's ...fxe4 or ...dxe4 would fork my Queen and
Knight. So moving the Knight out of the way. This move also allows for
f2-f3, attacking the Knight with my pawn. Of course, it's very likely that
Black would have answered Nb1-d2 with ...Ne4xd2, so it would have been
better to start with that move, leaving the f3-Knight on its more natural
square. This move opens the way for Black's dark-squared Bishop. See exf6
variation for what Stockfish suggests.} (13. exf6 gxf6 14. Bh6) 13. .. Bh4
14. Be3 {This move was based on a miscalculation from my part. I saw both
the e4-Knight and the h4-Bishop attacking f2, and decided to defend it. But
f2 is already defended twice: by the Rook and the King, so it didn't need
any defence. (Black attacking it would net me a Bishop and a Knight for a
Rook and a pawn.) Further, f2-f3 would chase away the Knight, which has
been the main goal of my last moves. It exposes the e1-Knight to the
Bishop, but the Knight is defended by the Rook.} f4 15. Bxf4 {This seemed
to be a free pawn, so I grabbed it. Stockfish thinks this move is a
mistake, and wants me to pull back the Bishop to d2. See 15...Bxf2
variation for what Stockfish thinks Black should have done after 15.Bxf4.}
O-O {Adds a third attacker on f2 .} (15. .. Bxf2+ 16. Rxf2 Nxf2 17. Kxf2
Rf8) 16. Qe3 {Stockfish says pulling the Bishop back to e3, or g2-g3, are
better moves.} Bd7 17. Nd2 {This is the move I've been wanting to play for
a long time. Now this move is a serious mistake though. Fortunately, Black
did not capitalize on it, but see ...Rxf4-variation what could have
happened. (I didn't see this during the game, obviously. It was shown to my
by Stockfish during analysis.) Stockfish suggests Ne1-d3 here. I want to
move that Knight too, since I see a good home for it on c5 (after having
read the chapter on Knights in Reassess Your Chess).} Bg5 (17. .. Rxf4 18.
Qxf4 Bg5 19. Qg4 Nxd2 {Wins a piece. Also, my f1-Rook is trapped and up for
taking.}) 18. g3 {Adds a defender to the f4-Bishop. This is pretty bad for
White, however, sine it seriously weakens the pawns in front of the King.
Further, after ...Bxf4 gxf4 (which was the reason I moved the pawn in the
first place), the King's pawn defense is completly shattered. And lo and
behold, this also turned out to be my downfall later in the game. See
Bxg5-variation for what Stockfish suggests.} (18. Bxg5 Qxg5 19. Qxg5 Nxg5
20. Nd3 g6 21. Nc5 {Stockfish evaluates this position to almost +3 for
White.}) 18. .. Bxf4 19. gxf4 {...and Black has an open road to my King.}
Nxd2 20. Qxd2 {A good exchange for Black (I think), since it took my Queen
away from an important square. Stockfish evaluates this position as more or
less equal. White is one pawn up, however, which means Black has the better
position.} Qh4 {Here Stockfish suggests 20...Nc3-a5 and 21...Na5-c4 for
Black. (Stockfish has also read the chapter on Knights in Reassess Your
Chess!) The Queen-side has been left dormant by both sides for the last 10
moves.} 21. Nd3 {Heading for c5. I didn't think Black's Queen would be able
to make much damage immediately, so thought I would sneak in this move.
Stockfish wants to move my Queen to e3, to defend the g4-square.} Be8
{Obviously going for h4. Black is building up a serious attack.} 22. Nc5 {I
ignore the threat, and ge my Knight to c5. I have two plans in mind: There
is a Rook-fork on d7 (once the Bishop moves), and the e6-pawn is weak.
Removing the e4-pawn would allow by a2-Bishop to enter into the game. One
problem with this move is that it removes a defender of the f4-pawn, which
is attacked twice but only defended once. I'll play out the ...Rxf4
variation to see what Stockfish thinks about it. Btw, Stockfish suggests
f2-f3. In hindsight I understand why: Black wants to place his Queen or
Bishop on f3. By moving my pawn there, that square is defended by my Rook
(and, probably, my Queen as well).} Qg4+ (22. .. Rxf4 23. f3 {Stockfish
doesn't think this is too great for Black.}) 23. Kh1 Qf3+ 24. Kg1 Bh5
{Threatening Qh3-Bf3-Qg2#.} 25. Qe3 {Must get rid of that Queen.} Rbe8 {I
don't understand this move. ...Rxf4 would have been better for Black,
netting that hanging pawn.} 26. Qxf3 Bxf3 {Stockfish evaluates this
position as almost equal. Again, White is up one pawn in material.} 27. Nd3
{I don't like having to retreat my Knight, but at this point I've realized
that the g4-pawn is hanging, so I went to defend it. Stockfish suggests
h2-h3 here, providing the King an outlet on h2. That would have proven very
useful later in the game, as it turned out.} Rb8 28. Rfe1 Ne7 29. Re3 Be4
{Look at that center!} 30. Nc5 {Back to the nice c5 square. My g4-pawn is
still hanging, but so is Black's e6-pawn.} Nf5 {This proved to be the
turning point in the game. White is in a very good position here, but I
blundered it away completely. I thought long and hard here (the results
don't show it...). The Black Knight is threatening my Rook, but my Knight
is threatening to fork the two Black Rooks. I also had ideas of going pawn
grabbing: Something like: 31.Nxe6 Re8 32. Nxc7 Re7 33. Nxd5 Bxd5 34. Bxd5+,
the return of the Light-Squared Bishop! That line relies on Black
co-operating quite a lot though.} 31. Re2 {Mistake. My thinking was that my
c5-Knight would still be able to cause a lot of damage, so it wouldn't hurt
to move my own Rook out of the way first. See Rxe4 variation for what I
should have played.} (31. Rxe4 dxe4 32. Bxe6+ Kh8 33. Nd7 {Stockfish says
this is almost +5 for White.}) 31. .. Rb6 32. Nxe6 {Another mistake, and
this one even worse. I thought the Knight couldn't be captured by the Rook,
since Bxd5 would pin and win the Rook. I completely missed that d5 is
protected by the e4-Bishop! Rxe4 is still the better move.} Bd3 {Black did
not take my hanging Knight.} 33. Rd2 {The only move in this sequence that
Stockfish agrees with.} Rd8 {A trap. And I walked right into it.} 34. Nxd8
Rg6+ {BAM! It took me a second or two to fully appreciate the trouble I was
in. The game is lost here.} 35. Kh1 {Only move. I should have gotten rid of
that Bishop!} Be4+ 36. f3 {Only move.} Bxf3+ 37. Rg2 {Only move.} Rxg2 38.
Rf1 {Forced, otherwise ...Rg4 is mate.} Rxb2+ 39. Rxf3 Rxa2 {Next up is the
a3-pawn, and then the c3-pawn could go too. There also the threat of ...Nh4
followed by ...Ra1#. Here is where it would have been good if my h-pawn was
on h3 instead. And of course, the a4-pawn is eyeing promotion.} 40. Rf1
{The mate threat, and my hanging pawns, leaves me very few options.
Prevents the Black Rook from checking me on the first rank. Will head over
to c1 next, to protect the c3-pawn.} Rxa3 41. Rc1 Ra2 42. Nc6 Rb2 43. Nb4
{Here both Black and I missed this nice tactic: 43...Nxd4 44.cxd4 Rxb4,
taking the Knights off the board and winning Black a pawn.} Nh4 {A new
threat emerges: Nf3-Rxh2#.} 44. Rf1 {Preventing ...Nf3. Stockfish suggests
moving my King to g1 instead.} Rd2 45. Nxd5 a3 46. e6 {Trying a desperate
pawn push. It's doomed to fail: My lone Knight can't stave off both the
Black King and the Black Rook, which can move to the e-file as it sees fit.
My own Rook is helpless.} Rb2 47. e7 Re2 {Stops my pawn in its
tracks.

BUT. Stockfish claims this is in fact a blunder for Black. See
48.f5 variation for why.} 48. Kg1 (48. f5 Kf7 {(Kg8-f7 f5-f6 g7xf6 Rf1xf6+

up, and probably winning, but it's all of a sudden a much closer game.})
