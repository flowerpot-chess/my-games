1. e4 d5 {-0.32/22 51} 2. exd5 c6 {-0.68/21 43 Surprising. ...Qd5 is the
standard move in the Scandinavian.} 3. dxc6 e5 {-0.92/22 60 Another
suprise. ...Nxc6 would be expected.} 4. cxb7 Bxb7 {-1.85/22 46 Here White
has to be careful, since Black is threatening ...Bxg2, which wins the
Rook.} 5. Bb5+ Nc6 {-2.00/21 37} 6. Nf3 {I was a little bit nervous about
this move, since I wasn't sure how to best respond to ...e4.} e4 {-2.18/20
49} 7. Ne5 {Taking advantage of the pin on the Black Knight. Houdini
suggests Qe2 here, pinning the e4-pawn.} Qc7 {-2.02/21 53} (7. .. Qd5 {This
is the move recommended by Houdini after White's 7.Ne5. I did not see that
move.} 8. Bxc6+ Bxc6 9. Nxc6 Qxc6) 8. d4 exd3 {-1.83/21 38} 9. Nxc6 a6

Queen-Bishop battery against g2.} 11. Qe2+ Be7 {-2.72/2138} 12. O-O Rd8

Rh4 {-5.03/23 46 Mate threat on h2.} 16. h3 {g2-g3 would also stop the
immediate threat, but I didn't like opening up the h1-a8 diagonal for the
Black Bishop.} f6 {-5.15/22 69 Takes away the threat of Bxg7.} 17. Nd2
{Eyeing f3, threatening the Rook. Also, Nc3 would have blocked the
b2-Bishop.} a5 {-7.23/21 70} 18. Bb5+ Bc6 {-7.61/22 55} 19. Bxc6+ Qxc6

I considered this move during the game, but couldn't really work it out.}

is the move recommended by Houdini. I didn't go for it because I didn't
quite know how to proceed after ...Rb7.} Qc8 {-8.60/22 46} 22. Rad1 h5

concerned about ...Bxb4, but found a line starting with Ne6+ that would
work out nicely.} axb4 {-14.72/2347} (24. .. Bxb4 25. Ne6+ Kf7 26. Rd8 Ne7

considered Rd8+, which could lead to a quick mate if Black captures with
the wrong piece. I couldn't work out all the variations, however, and
decided to skip that idea. It turns out Rd8+ was indeed the best move. See
variations.} (26. Rd8+ Bxd8 (26. .. Qxd8 27. Qb5+ Kf7 28. Nxd8+) 27. Nc7+

Black to give up his Queen for a Rook, or a quick mate follows. See
