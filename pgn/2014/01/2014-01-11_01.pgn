1. d4 {This was a quick game on my phone, while patrolling the sidewalk
outside Chinese School as a Traffic Safety Volunteer.} Nf6 2. c4 {Had just
gone through the Korchnoi - Kasparov (1982) game in Seirawan's Winning
Chess Brilliances. That game opens with 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4, which Seirawan
says is the "standard response".} g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. d5 {Rybka suggests Nc3
here.} d6 5. g3 {Decided to do what Kasparov did: fianchetto my Bishop too.
:)} Bf5 6. Nc3 {Not sure why I didn't fianchetto the Bishop right away.} c6
7. Bg2 Qb6 8. a4 {I had some vague idea about a4-a5. Not sure exactly what
that would accomplish, the Black Queen has several squares to move to.} a5
9. O-O Ne4 10. Nxe4 Bxe4 11. Nh4 {Rybka suggests 11. Ng5. I wanted to
protect the g2 Bishop with my Knight though. (This is unnecessary - the
King is also protecting g2.)} f5 12. Bxe4 fxe4 13. Rb1 {Breaking the pin
from Black's Bishop.} Bd4 14. e3 {Rybka suggests Qc2, attacking the
d4-pawn.} Bf6 15. Ng2 {Replacing the Bishop on g2.} O-O 16. b3 {Rybka
agrees with this move :)} Nd7 17. Bd2 cxd5 18. cxd5 Qc7 19. b4 {Having just
read the chapter on Knights in "Reassess Your Chess", had I paid attention
I would have noticed that the e6-square would have been an excellent
outpost for my Knight. So Nf4, followed by Ne6 would have been doog here.
That's also what Rybka suggests.

My intention with 19. b4 was ...axb4
20. Rxb4, threatening the e4-pawn. That's also what transpired.} axb4 20.
Rxb4 Be5 21. Rxe4 Nf6 {Winning back the pawn, and that excellent e6-outpost
for my Knight is gone (had I noticed it in the first place).} 22. Rh4
{Perhaps a bit risky, but I figured the h-file could be a possible attack
route to the Black King.} Nxd5 23. Qb3 {Pinning the Knight.} e6 {Unpinning
the Knight.} 24. e4 {Rybka doesn't like my Rook on h4, and suggests Rc4
here, followed by Rb1, doubling up on the b-file, possibly exchanging
queens (if Rc4 was followed by Qb6).} Nc3 25. Bxc3 Qxc3 {This is a mistake,
Black should have recaptured with the Bishop.} 26. Qxb7 {Threatening mate
in one on h7. I completely missed Qxe6+.} h5 27. Qe7 {Roundabout way of
getting that e6-pawn that was up for grabs one move ago.} Qc4 28. Qg5
{Threatening 29. Qxg6+, followed by 30. Rxh5. Or I could capture the
h5-pawn directly, since the g6-pawn is pinned.} Rf6 29. Ne3 Qxa4 {...Qe2
would have been better for Black.} 30. Ng4 {Rybka suggests Rxh4 first, and
then Ng4. This way worked out better for me, thanks to Black's weak next
move.} hxg4 31. Qh6 Bb2?? {Allows mate in two.} 32. Qh8+ Kf7 33. Rh7# 1-0
