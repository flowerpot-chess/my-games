1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Nf6 4. Nc3 cxd4 {Could also have captured with the
Queen. Another option would have been 5.Bb5+, followed by an exchange of
pieces on d7, before capturing the d4-pawn.} 5. Nxd4 a6 {The Najdorf
variation. This prepares ...e5 on the next move. The problem with 5...e5 is
that White can answer with 6.Bb5+, setting up an exchange of pieces on d7.
If 6...Bd7 7.Bxd7 Qxd7, exchanging off the light-squared Bishops, after
which the d5-square becomes very weak. If 6...Nbd7 7.Nf5 White threatens to
capture the d6-pawn.} 6. Be3 {Bg5 or Bc4 might have been better. Stockfish
recommends both those moves instead of the text.} Ng4 {This is why I don't
like the Be3 move. The only way to prevent the e3-Bishop from being
exchanged is to move it again, losing a tempo.} 7. Qd2 {Could also have
developed the f1-Bishop, and recapturing with the f2-pawn if the Knight
takes on e3.} Nxe3 8. Qxe3 g6 9. e5 Nc6 10. exd6 Qxd6 11. O-O-O {Serves two
purposes: Brings the King to safety, and adds a second defender of the
d4-Knight.} Nxd4 12. Rxd4 Qe6 {Considered a blunder by Stockfish. Qc6 would
have been better, or Bh6, which pins my Queen to my King. At this point I
wasn't aware of the fact that my Queen was on the same diagonal as my
King.} 13. Qd2 {This is also what the computer recommends. I'm not sure why
this is better than, say, Qd3, which brings the Queen off the c1-h6
diagonal. Because it blocks the f1-Bishop? Because it opens for ...Bh6+?}
Qb6 14. Nd5 {Threatening the Queen, and eyeing the fork on c7.} Qc6 {The
Black Queen has now moved Qd6-e6-b6-c6 in three straight moves.} 15. Rc4!
{I'm very happy with this move. Threatening the Queen, and the c7-fork is
also very much a possibility. I couldn't see a way for Black to deal with
both threats.} Bh6! {This came as a surprise to me (it shouldn't have).
Only now did I become aware of the risk for a Queen-King pin.} 16. Rxc6
{This was the move that I spent most time thinking about. Realized that,
since the c7-fork is still alive, Rxc6 would start an exchange that would
leave me a piece up (the h6-Bishop). I did not see the move recommended by
the computer (f4 - see variation).} (16. f4 16. .. Qd7 17. Nc7+ Kf8 18.
Nxa8 Qxd2+ 19. Kxd2) (16. f4 Qd7 17. Nc7+ Kf8 18. Nxa8 Qxd2+ 19. Kxd2 Bxf4+
20. Kc3) 16. .. Bxd2+ 17. Kxd2 {At this point I'm up a piece in the
exchange, and Black has the choice of keeping the Rooks on the Board, e.g.
by Bc8-d7.} bxc6 18. Nc7+ Kd7 19. Nxa8 Rd8 20. Bd3 {Blocks the d8-Rook from
a potential discovered check.} Kd6 21. Nb6 Be6 22. Nc4+ {Offers an exchange
of Bishop and Knight. This should benefit me, since I'm a piece up.} Bxc4
23. Bxc4 Ke5+ 24. Kc3 {A month ago I would probably have placed Kc1, but
the text turns the King into a more active piece in the endgame. I'm
learning!} e6 25. Bxa6 Ra8 26. Bc4 Ke4 27. Rd1 Ra7 28. Kb4 {Eyeing the
c6-pawn.} Rb7+ 29. Kc5 Rxb2? {Wins a pawn, but allows the Rook to be
trapped!} 30. Bb3! {Traps the Rook.} h6 31. Kxc6 h5 32. Kc5 {I still hadn't
completely grasped the full implication of the poor b2-Rook's hopeless
situation. The Rook is completely trapped *even without the a2-pawn*. At
this point I should have started pushing the a-pawn towards promotion.
Instead I decided to pluck the Rook off the board.} g5 33. Kc4 f5 34. Kc3
Rxb3+ 35. Kxb3 h4 36. a4 {The assault of the Black pawns made me feel
uncomfortable, and made me try out different variations on the board.
Decided they weren't a real threat yet.} h3 37. gxh3 Kf3 38. a5 Ke2 39. Ra1
g4 40. a6 g3 {Black should have captured the f2-pawn instead.} 41. fxg3 f4
