1. e4 Nc6 {-0.32/21 37} 2. Nf3 {Decided to try 2.Nf3 against the
Nimzowitsch. According to wikipedia, this is the most common move according
to some databases. One reason is that 2...e5 transposes the opening into a
normal King's Pawn opening, that is probably more familiar to most
players.} d5 {-0.22/22 72 Of course, Black decided to go for a less common
line. From now on I'm on my own.} 3. exd5 Na5 {-0.76/22 53 I expected
...Qxd5.} 4. Nc3 {3.b4 would have trapped the Black Knight. Not for free
though, I'd have to give back the pawn I won, and give up another one as
well. See variation. The text prevents ...Qxd5, allowing me to keep the
pawn I won.} (4. b4 Qxd5 5. bxa5 Qxa5) 4. .. c6 {-2.04/22 52} 5. dxc6
{Again, b2-b4 would have trapped the Knight.} Nf6 {-1.75/22 52 Allowing me
to keep my two-pawn advantage. Black has given away two pawns in the
opening - very suspect!} 6. cxb7 Nxb7 {-2.70/23 64 6...Bxc7 would probably
have been better, since it develops the Bishop.} 7. Bb5+ Bd7 {-3.17/22 39}
8. d4 {I considered exchanging Bishops here, but decided to push my d-pawn
instead. I figured that 8...Bxb5 9.Nxb5 would be OK, since the Knight on b5
eyes a possible fork on c7 . I failed to see 9...Qa5+, which would force my
Knight back to c3. Accordingly, Stockfish wants me to exchange Bishops
first, then d2-d4.} a6 {-2.76/21 40 Exchanging Bishops would probably have
been better for Black.} 9. Bxd7+ Nxd7 {-3.61/22 46 Again, capturing with
the Queen would probably have been better, since it develops a piece and
leaves the Knight on f6.} 10. d5 g6 {-3.77/26 50} 11. Qd4 {Prevents ...Bg7.
Also allows for Qa4, pinning the Knight.} Nf6 {-3.75/27 39 Opens up for
...Bg7 again.} 12. Ne5 Bg7 {-3.75/23 47} 13. Qa4+ Nd7 {-3.65/23 49} 14. Nc6
Bxc3+ {-3.85/22 42 I did not anticipate this move. Figured it actually made
my situation better, since bxc3 opens up the b-file for my Rook.} 15. bxc3
Nb6 {-6.60/23 52} 16. Nxd8+ {Starts an exchange that will win me a piece
(in addition to the two pawns I'm already up). See Qd4 variation for an
attacking idea I missed.} (16. Qd4 {Now I'm threatening both the Queen and
the Rook. Black can't save both.} Qxd5 17. Qxh8+ Kd7 18. Ne5+ Kc7 19. Qg7
Qxg2 20. Rf1 Nd5) 16. .. Nxa4 {-5.69/22 42} 17. Nxb7 {Concludes the
exchange. There are a couple of problems with my position here. The c3-pawn
is hanging, and after ...Nxc3 the d5-pawn is hanging as well. Also, my King
is still out in the open, and my h1-Rook still tucked away in its corner. I
had considered castling earlier, but decided to keep the attack going
instead .} Ra7 {-5.69/23 59} 18. Rb1 {Here I saw the possibility of winning
the h8-Rook. For example, 19.Nc5 Nxc5 20.Rb8+.} Kd7 {-7.01/24 68 Stops my
ideas of winning the h8-Rook. Also made me nervous about ...Rb8, since it
seemed to me that would win Black my Knight. In hindsight, I think Nc5+
would have turned the table. See variation.} 19. Bf4 {To stop the imaginary
threat of ...Rb8. Stockfish wants me to push my c3-pawn, which is hanging.
On the other hand, this move turns out to indirectly prevent ...Nxc3. See
19...Nxc3 variation for the bad things that happen to Black if he captures
my pawn.} (19. c4 Rb8 20. Nc5+ Nxc5 (20. .. Kc7 21. Rxb8 (21. Bf4+ e5 22.

21. Kd2 {Adds another defender to the c3-pawn, and also provides an outlet
for the h1-Rook. I'm very happy I found this move.} Nc5 {-9.01/23 45} 22.
Nxc5+ {Stockfish wants Rhe1 here.} Rxc5 {-8.76/24 50} 23. Rb7+ Kc8
{-8.76/22 10 Here I wanted to follow up with Rh1-b1, but was scared away by
24.Rhb1 Rxd5+. In hindsight that might not have been too bad, after
25.Bd4?} 24. Bd4 {Does two things: Offers a Rook exchange (which would be
great for White, considering White's material advantage), and makes sure
...Rxd5 is not a check. Stockfish suggests Rxe7 here, which makes sense,
since I'm about to lose my d5-pawn anyway.} Ra5 {-9.27/24 65 Black does not
go for the Rook-exchange.} 25. Rxe7 Rb8 {-10.32/25 58} 26. Rhe1 {26.c4
would have protected the d5-pawn. I preferred doubling up on the e-file,
preparing to attack.} Rxd5 {-11.73/25 109} 27. Rxf7 Kd8 {-14.20/26 62} 28.

(currently pinned), e.g. for 29.Bf6+.} (28. Kc1 a5 {Random move.} 29. Bf6+

{Stockfish suggests h2-h4, which makes sense. Either way wins the g5-pawn.}
Rd8 {-97.27/31 52 Black resigns} 35. fxg5 {Stockfish says I should have
captured with my Rook instead. To avoid doubling up the pawns on the
f-file?} a5 {-146.49/32 220 Black resigns} 36. Rh8 Rd6 {-98.58/24 51 Black
resigns} 37. Rh6 a4 {-101.21/24 56 Black resigns} 38. Rxd6 a3 {-M11/29 49
