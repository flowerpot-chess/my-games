1. e4 d5 {The Scandinavian defense again.} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+ {This
is the "Patzer variation". ...Qa5 is the standard move.} 4. Be2 c5 5. Nf3
{Developing and attacking the Queen.} Qd6 6. d4 {Considered castling here,
but realized that it would be difficult for me to contest the d4-square
after ...Nb6.} Bf5 {Prevents 7.Ne4.} 7. Be3 {Adds support to d4 in case of
...Nb6. Stockfish suggests Nb5 here, attacking the Queen.} cxd4 8. Nxd4
{The correct piece to capture with (I think, and Stockfish agrees).
Stockfish suggests another move though (see Nb5 variation).} (8. Nb5 Qd8 9.
Qxd4 a6 10. Qxd8+ Kxd8 11. Bb6+ Kc8 12. Nc7 Ra7 13. Ne5) 8. .. Bg6 9. O-O
{Getting my King to safety. Stockfish is still begging for Nb5. See
variation.} (9. Ndb5 Qxd1+ 10. Rxd1 Na6 {To prevent Nc7+, forking the King
and the Rook.} 11. Nd5 {All of a sudden threatening mate! 12.Ndc7+ Nxc7
13.Nxc7#}) 9. .. e5 10. Bb5+ {Stockfish still wants Nb5. That move went out
the window now that I placed my Bishop there instead} Nd7 11. Nf3
{Retreating the Knight, and offering a Queen exchange.} (11. Qf3 {This was
the move suggested by Stockfish. It's not clear to me why this is good for
White after exd4, so I'll play out that variation here and see what
happens.} exd4 12. Bf4 {After this move Stockfish says O-O-O is Black's
best move. What happens if Black tries to safe his Queen?} Qf6 (12. .. Qc5
13. Bxd7+ Kxd7 14. Qxb7+ Kd8 15. Qxa8+) 13. Bxd7+ Kd8 14. Qxb7 Qxf4 15. Bh3
{Threatening mate on d7.} f5 (15. .. Nf6 16. Qxa8+ Kc7 17. Qxa7+) 16. Qxa8+
Kd7 17. Qxf8 dxc3 18. Qxg7+ Kc6 19. Qxh8 Bf7 20. Rad1) 11. .. O-O-O 12.
Qxd6 {Stockfish suggests keeping the Queens on the board: Qe2.} Bxd6 13.
Bxa7 {Grabbing a pawn. My own c2 pawn is hanging to the g6-Bishop, but I
figured it wouldn't be bad for me if Black went for it; after 13...Bxc2
14.Rc1 B[somewhere] I now have an open file towards the Black King.} Ngf6
(13. .. Bxc2 14. Rac1 Bg6 15. Ne4+) 14. Rfd1 {I also considered Rfe1. Went
for this move, which attacks the hanging d6-Bishop.} e4 15. Ng5 {This move
was based on a gross oversight from my side. My idea was that this move
threatens both Nxf7, forking the Rooks, and Rxd6, winning the Bishop. It
was only after the move that I realized that f7 is protected by the
g6-Bishop! This move gave me some headache later on, since there is no good
square for the Knight to go to.

Stockfish suggests Rxd6, exchanging the
Bishop for my Rook (see variation).} (15. Rxd6 exf3 16. Rad1 Nb8 (16. ..
Ne5 17. Rxd8+ Rxd8 18. Rxd8+ Kxd8 19. Bd4) 17. Rxd8+ Rxd8 18. Rxd8+ Kxd8
19. Bxb8) 15. .. Be5 16. Nd5 {Stockfish (who agrees with this move)
evaluates this position to +0.94 for White. Since White is a pawn up, I
suppose that means our positions are roughly equal?

Before making this
move I had calculated two lines:

16...Nxd5
17.Rxd5 Bxb2
18.Rad1
mounting an attack on d7.

16...Bxb2
17.Ne7+ Kc7
18.Rab1
B[somewhere]
19.Nxg6. Now if ...fxg6 or hxg6, 20.Nf7 forks the Rooks.}
Rhf8 {I had not prepared for this move.} 17. Ne7+ {Stockfish suggests Bd7+
instead, setting off a flurry of exchanges.} (17. Bxd7+ Nxd7 18. Ne7+ Kc7
19. Nxg6 hxg6 20. Bd4 Bxd4 21. Rxd4) 17. .. Kc7 18. Nxg6 hxg6 {If ...fxg6
then 19.Ne6 wins a Rook.} 19. Bd4 {Here I realized that ...b6 would trap my
Bishop (same thing happened in my bad loss on January 18, which is probably
why I saw it this time). This is a strong move. After 19...Bxd4 20.Rxd4 I'm
now also attacking the e4-pawn.} Bxd4 20. Rxd4 Nc5 21. Rc4 {Here I thought
a long time. The main candidate move was Rd1, but decided to go for the
Knight pin. Calculated a couple of lines and thought I would come out
ahead. I also realized that from now on I had to very careful about back
rank mates. I considered pushing a pawn to make luft, but didn't want to
lose a tempo.} b6 22. b4! {Wins the Knight, which can't move.} e3 23. fxe3
{Thought about this for a while, and concluded that Black's situation
wouldn't be improved at all by me taking the e3-pawn here. The pinned
Knight is not going anywhere. Also, this move lessens the risk of a back
rank mate.} Nd7 24. bxc5 Nxc5 {Now Black's other Knight is pinned!} 25. Ne4
{Adding another attacker to the pinned Knight. Figured an exchange would
benefit me, especially since I would win the pawn as well.} Rd5 {Saw this
move myself right after I moved my Knight. Black adds a defender to the
pinned Knight, so can keep his pawn after an exchange.} 26. Nxc5 {Went for
the exchange anyway, since I'm up in material. Stockfish wants a2-a4 here.}
Rxc5 {This is a mistake. Black should have recaptured with the b-pawn
(which is what I had anticipated). Now his Rook is pinned, and I can
exchange it at the time of my choosing.} 27. a4 {Decided to push the
a-pawn, and let Black initiate the exchange. I figured that the Rooks would
be exchanged anyway, and this way I would win a tempo in getting my a-pawn
towards promotion. Stockfish doesn't agree with me, however, and wants me
to exchange Rooks right away here.} Rd8 28. Rxc5+ {Got nervous about the
d8-Rook being up to some shenanigans, and decided to exchange the Rooks
before I had time to blunder the situation away :)} bxc5 29. a5 {After this
move it struck me that one bad thing about my position is my inactive King.
But my extra Bishop should presumably outweigh this.} c4 {Another blunder,
that gives away another pawn for free.} 30. Bxc4 {Grabs the offered pawn,
and attacks the f7-pawn to boot.} Rf8 {Another questionable move. Surely it
must be better to push the f-pawn, and keeping the Rook active.} 31. a6 Ra8
32. a7 {Here I first considered Bd5, but that would allow Black to respond
with ...Ra7, and things would get stuck for a while. The text leaves Black
helpless. Move the Rook away, and my pawn gets promoted (and Black looses
his Rook if he captures the new Queen). Leave the Rook where it is, and I
move my Bishop to d5, unless ...Kc6, in which case I pick off the f7-pawn.}
f6 33. Bd5 Rb8 {Here I faced another choice: a7xb8Q, or a7-a8Q. The former
would more or less force ...Kxb8. The latter would most likely result in
...Rxa8 34.Rxa8, ending up in the same position as the first option.

I
figured to go with the second option, due to the outside chance of Black
not capturing my new Queen, which I figured would lead to a quicker win for
me. 

Btw, Stockfish recommends axb8Q, which apparently leads to a forced
mate in 13.} 34. a8=Q g5 35. Qc6+ {Stockfish found a quicker mate (by one
move): see Ra7 variation.} (35. Ra7+ Rb7 36. Qxb7+ Kd6 37. Qc6+ Ke5 38.
