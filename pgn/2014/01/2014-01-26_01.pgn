1. e4 e5 {(e7-e5 Ng1-f3 Nb8-c6 Bf1-b5 a7-a6) -0.40/19 3} 2. Nf3 d6 {The
Philidor Defence.} 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 {One of the main lines from
Wikipedia.} Be7 {From now on I'm on my own.} 5. Nc3 {Stockfish suggests Be2
first, then Nc3.} Bf6 {This move surprised me over the board, but it's also
the move recommended by Stockfish after 4.Nc3. After 4.Be2 Stockfish
recommends 4...Nf6 for Black. Can't say I understand the difference.} 6.
Bc4 {Had early ideas about Qf3, putting pressure on f7 (assuming the
f6-Bishop moves or is forced away). Stockfish recommends 6.Be3 (backing up
the d4-Knight), which I played as my 7th move.} Qe7 7. Be3 {Considered
castling, but decided to develop the Bishop first, also giving more support
to d4. Funny how it turned out that this decision actually resulted in my
castling being postponed for another 13 moves, not one!

Btw, Stockfish
recommends castling here.} Be6 8. Nxe6 {Here I first considered being
tricky, by playing Bd5, inticing Black's Bishop to initiate the exchange,
rather than the other way around. The reason was that after 8.Bxd6 fxd6 I
didn't like Black's two central pawns. And the couple of lines I calculated
after 8...Bxd5 all looked promising for White.

The problem is that after
8.Bd5 Black responds with 8...c6. This is of course a common beginner
mistake: Black does not have to capture on d5 just because I want him
to!

After thinking a while I decided to take with the Knight instead,
keeping both my Bishops. I missed a much better move though, shown to me by
Stockfish in post-game analysis. See Nd5-variation.} (8. Nd5 Bxd5 9. Bxd5
c6 10. Nf5 Qd7 11. Bb3) 8. .. Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 fxe6 {I have both my Bishops,
Black has both his Rooks. Stockfish says White is +1.74 here. I don't like
White's pawn structure, but Black is behind in development.} 10. Qh5+ Qf7
{This move surprised me. I was anticipating 10...g6, after which 11.Qh3
would attack the e6-pawn.} 11. Qxf7+ {I was so taken aback by Black's last
move, that I didn't realize that my planned Qh3 move was still a good
option! Instead I decided to exhange Queens, forcing the Black King to
move. This is a much worse move than Qh3 according to Stockfish. The
resulting position is evaluated to +0.80 for White, whereas Qh3 followed by
Bxe6 is evaluated at about +2.50.} (11. Qh3 Nd7 (11. .. d5 12. Bxd5 exd5
13. Qc8+ Ke7 14. Bc5+ Kf6 15. Qf5#) 12. Bxe6) 11. .. Kxf7 12. f4 {The
e6-pawn is pinned, so I decided to attack it with f2-f4-f5.} Nc6 13. f5 Ke7
14. Bxe6 Nh6 {Bad move. The normal ...Nf6 would have been better.} 15. Bg5+
Ke8 16. f6 {Safe, since ...gxf6 and the h6-Knight falls.} Nf7 17. fxg7 Rg8
18. Bf6 {Interesting position, where neither the f7-Knight, nor the
g8-Rook, nor the e8-King can move! This means the only threat to my Bishops
is the Knight currently on c6.} Nce5 {...Nd8 would have been stronger,
since it would have forced my e6-Bishop to move.} 19. h3 {My purpose was to
stop the Knight from moving to g4. According to Stockfish, this is a huge
mistake. After 19.O-O, Stockfish evaluates my position to something like
+9. But after 19.h3 Nd7 (a move I missed) the position is evaluated to
+2.6.} a5 {Weird, random(?) move.} 20. O-O {Finally castling :) Not to get
the King to safety, as much as to get the h1-Rook to f1, at the same time
connecting it with the a1-Rook. Thanks to Black's weak last move, Stockfish
again evaluates this position to +8 or so for White.

I considered
several other options here:

+ Pushing the g-pawn. Would allow Nf3+
though.
+ Pushing the c-pawn. The end goal would be to attack d6,
undermining the defense of the e5-Knight. This would be a slow process,
however, since d6 is protected by c7. I could push both c-pawns, but that
would take several moves.
+ Rd1, perhaps followed by c4.
+ Rb1.} Ng6 21.
g3 {Preparing for h3-h4-h5. Going for that Knight.} c6 {Preparing for
...d5? Creating space for the a8-Rook to come in and attack the e6-Bishop?}
22. h4 b5 23. h5 Nf8 {Finally forces some action in the locked position
around Black's King.} 24. gxf8=Q+ {Spent a long time thinking about
alternatives here. Mainly Bxf7+. One concern is my weak g3 pawn. After
Rg8xg3+ I could very well end up losing the c3-pawn as well, depending on
where my dark-squared Bishop goes.} Kxf8 25. g4 {To prevent the g8 Rook
from taking the g-pawn (which is now covered by the
e6-Bishop).

According to Stockfish, Bd4 is a much stronger move. See
variation.} (25. Bd4 Rxg3+ 26. Kh2 Ra7 27. Bxf7 Rxf7 28. Kxg3 Rxf1 29.
Rxf1+) 25. .. h6 26. Bh4 Ra7 27. Rf6 Ke8 28. Raf1 d5 29. Rxf7 {Take with
the Rook, not the Bishop, so that if ...Ra7xf7, Bxf7+ forks the King and
the Rook.} Rxg4+ 30. Bxg4 {According to Stockfish, this is a forced mate in
9. Black, however, decided to commit harakiri.} b4 31. Rf8# 1-0
