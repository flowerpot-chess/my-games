1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d5 {The Elephant Gambit! My first game (I think) against
this opening.} 3. exd5 {White accepts the gambit. This is the main line,
according to Wikipedia.} Ne7 {Black immediately leaves the main line. Now
I'm on my own.} 4. Nc3 {Stockfish suggests 4.c4. I liked this move because
it develops by Knight normally, and the Knight also covers the
e4-square.

Note that where as c2-c4 would prevent the e7-Knight from
taking my e5-pawn outright (unless Black wants to gambit his Knight too!),
Nc3 does not, since the Black Queen is also attacking d5 (meaning Black is
free to take back the pawn he's lost).} Nxd5 5. Nxe5 {This is also the move
recommended by Stockfish. I know expected Black to follow with Nxc3, giving
me doubled pawns on the c-file after I recapture.} Nd7 {Not the expected
move.} 6. d4 {Protects the Knight, but not a very good move (see the
7...Nxe5 variation for an example what this move could result in). See
variations for what Stockfish suggests here.} (6. Nxf7 6. .. Qe7+ 7. Qe2
Qxe2+ 8. Bxe2 Kxf7 9. Nxd5 {White is two pawns up, and the Black King is
exposed.}) (6. Qh5 Nxe5 7. Qxe5+ Be6) 6. .. Nxc3 7. bxc3 Qe7 {Pins the
Knight. See variation for a stronger move for Black.} (7. .. Nxe5 8. dxe5
Qxd1+ 9. Kxd1 {White is a pawn up, but the White King can no longer castle,
and the White pawn structure is suspicious.}) 8. Be2 {Unpins the Knight,
which is crucial to prevent ...f6, which would win the Knight. This gives
up a pawn (after 8...Nxe5 9.dxe5 Qxe5), but I'm a pawn up so I was OK with
that.

Note that 8.Qe2 (which is what Stockfish recommends) would have
allowed me to keep the pawn, but would also allow Black to force a Queen
exchange, and I like my Queen :)} Nxe5 9. dxe5 Qxe5 {The epxected exchange.
An unexpected (for me) outcome was that Black is now threatening a
devastating ...Qxc3+.} 10. Bd2 {Considered Bb2 or a Queen move, but settled
for Bd2. No concrete reason. Stockfish suggests Qd4. I suppose one good
thing with that move is that a Queen exchange would undouble my pawns.} Bf5
11. O-O {Getting my King to safety. Initially I was concerned about
...Bxc2, since recapturing with my Queen would seemingly hang my e2-Bishop
to the Black Queen. But then I realized that after ...Qxe2, Rfe1 would be
pretty devastating for Black. (Hold that thought.)} Bd6 {Threatening mate
on h2!} 12. f4 {Debated between this move and g3 (which is what Stockfish
recommends). Decided on f4 since it felt more active, attacking the Queen.}
Qd5 13. c4 {After I made this move I kicked myself, because a couple of
moves back, when the Black Queen was still on the e-file, I had eyed
Be2-b5+ as a possible chock attack after Rfe1, if Black would allow it. But
now I've denied my Bishop that opportunity!} Qe4 14. Re1 {Lining up the
Rook on the e-file.} Bc5+ 15. Kh1 b6 {Black blunders, and it costs him the
game!} 16. Bf3 Qxe1+ 17. Qxe1+ Be7 18. Bxa8 Bxc2 {Thought long and hard
about this position. I had to stop here (to go to work), but before I left
I decided that Ba8-c6+ would be a good move, forcing the King to move and
preventing Black from castling.

When I came back to the game after work
I suddenly thought that Bd2-b4 would be an absolute killer, but then
realized that Black could just castle his way out of that spot. Finally I
saw that Ba8-c6+ first, *then* Bd2-b4 would be very strong.

Of course,
White is totally winning either way (unless I blunder badly), but I really
wanted to find the strongest possible continuation.} 19. Bc6+ Kd8 (19. ..
Kf8 20. Bb4 h6 21. Qxe7+ Kg8) 20. Bb4 (20. Qe5 {Stockfish likes Bd2-b4, but
found this even stronger move, which apparently is a forced mate in 10.}
Kc8 (20. .. Re8 21. Qd5+ Bd6 22. Qxf7) 21. Qxe7) 20. .. Bd6 {This move
surprised me. I had counted on 20...Bxb4 21.Qxb4.} 21. Qd2 {Stockfish finds
a mate in 11 after Qh4+.} Kc8 22. Bxd6 Rd8 23. Qxc2 Rxd6 24. Qe4 {Starting
from 21.Qd2, this was exactly the line I had calculated. In analysis,
Stockfish pointed out to me that 23.Qd5 would provide a more forced path to
the same (more or less) position.} Rd8 25. Bb7+ {See Re1 variation for a
shorter (by one move) path to mate.} (25. Re1 b5 26. Qe8 Kb8 (26. .. bxc4
27. Qxd8+ Kxd8 28. Re8#) 27. Qxd8#) 25. .. Kb8 (25. .. Kd7 26. Rd1#) 26.
Ba6 {First I thought Ba8, followed by Qb7, would be good, but after Ba8 the
King can escape via Kc8.} c6 27. Qxc6 Rd1+ {The threat of a back rank mate
had been in my mind all the time, so there was no way I was going to have
let myself be beaten that way.} 28. Rxd1 b5 29. Qb7# {A game with two
faces. Black definitely won the opening phase, and had a strong attack
going until he blundered his Queen. After that it was an easy win for
White. Lesson (hopefully) learned: Play better against the Elephant Gambit
the next time!} 1-0
